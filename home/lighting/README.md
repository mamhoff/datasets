This category contains data for calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated
with indoor lighting. There are two entries: one is for a typical
**tungsten-filament** light bulb and the other is for a typical **low
energy** light bulb.

To use this category, specify the light bulb type using the *type* drill
option. Next set the quantity of light bulbs used. For 'normal' light
bulbs, set this quantity using the ***noOfLightBulbs*** profile item
value. For lower-energy light bulbs, use the
***noOfLowEnergyLightBulbs*** profile item value.

The returned amount represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with typical
usage of the specified quantity of bulbs.
