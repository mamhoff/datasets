The AMEE category /home/waste contains CO<sub>2</sub> emissions factors
associated with disposal of a variety of household waste products and
disposal methods.

The data incorporates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with treating and
transporting of waste as well as the emissions which are potentially
mitigated where future resource and energy consumption is reduced (e.g.
recycling). Depending on the disposal method selected, therefore, the
disposal of some waste types results in a negative value for CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions within AMEE - these values represent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions saved.
All data represents the aggregate global warming effect of six
greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH4, N2O, PFC's, HFC's, CFC's) expressed as
CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e).

To use this category select the type of waste using drill downs, then
enter the quantity of waste and a disposal method. If no disposal method
is entered AMEE will return a value associated with landfill disposal.

Disposal methods should be selected and entered as follows:

  - ***landfill***: this calculates the CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions associated
    with the disposal of waste in landfill sites.

<!-- end list -->

  - ***recycling***: this calculates the net CO<sub>2</sub>e emitted in the
    recycling of waste material (including potential emissions savings
    where future production is mitigated).

<!-- end list -->

  - ***thermal***: this calculates the CO<sub>2</sub>e emitted in the
    combustion of waste products.

<!-- end list -->

  - ***embodied***: these data represent the total CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions
    which are embodied within specific waste materials. These values
    therefore reflect the unit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of future production
    for a given material and can be considered to represent the CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions which are saved by choosing not to dispose of a particular
    waste product.

This data is sourced from the Waste Strategy for England 2007 Annex A
(DEFRA). Users should note that, while the absolute values are the same,
the signs (+/-) of values in AMEE are the opposite of those within the
source document. Thus, a net CO<sub>2</sub>e emission is positive (+) within
AMEE (in line with all other AMEE categories) while a CO<sub>2</sub>e saving is
negative (-).
