This methodology allows the user to calculate life-cycle emissions from
water. The methodology follows that from the latest
[Defra](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting)
data and advice which in turn is sourced from [Water
UK](http://www.water.org.uk/home/policy/reports/sustainability). Full
life-cycle emissions are calculated including contributions from carbon
dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.

## How to use this category

To use this category first use the drill-down ***type*** to select the
life-cycle emissions to be calculated from the following options.

  - supply

<!-- end list -->

  - treatment

<!-- end list -->

  - supply and treatment

The ***quantity*** of water is then entered as a profile item value. The
default units for this value are mÂ³. The algorithm then multiplies this
quantity by the relevant emission factor to give a result of kgCO,,2,,e,
which includes CO,,2,,, N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions.
