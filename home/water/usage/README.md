The water usage category calculates the emissions from certain household
activities such as using the dishwasher or showering.

Once the activity has been selected the emissions are calculated by one
of three methods

  - The number of minutes used per day - specified using the
    ***minutesPerDay*** profile item value (this method cannot be used
    for toilet flushing, bath, washing machine or dishwasher use).

<!-- end list -->

  - The number of uses per day (this method cannot be used for taps).

<!-- end list -->

  - If values are not entered for either of the above then an average
    value of litres used per day is used.

The litres used calculated from the user selected method is then
multiplied by the number of kg of CO<sub>2</sub> produced per litre (taken from
the home/water category).
