This methodology contains energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data
associated with several generic types and ranges of screen sizes of
television.

To use this methodology, select the television type and screen size
using the ***type*** and ***size*** drill choices. Next set the number
of hours for which the television is on, using the ***hoursOn***
parameter. The returned value represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated
with the specified television usage.

By default, emissions are calculated on the basis on the emissions
intensity of the UK electricity grid. If calculations are stored using
profiles, an alternative country can be specified within the profile
[metadata](metadata).

### Standby

Also in the case where calculations are stored using profiles, if the
*standby* item in the
[/home/appliances/entertainment/generic](Entertainment_generic) category
has been set, any profile items created in this category will
incorporate an estimate of emissions associated with the specified level
of standby usage, i.e. *emissions reflect those associated with both
full power and standby usage*.
