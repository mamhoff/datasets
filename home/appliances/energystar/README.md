This category contains data on various [Energy
Star](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home.index) rated products.
These are US products that reach a certain standard for energy usage.
The data in each subcategory uses a typical yearly usage value to
calculate the energy used per year. The relevant [ electricity emission
factor](Electricity_by_country), based on that entered in the
[metadata](Metadata) section is then used to calculate the kgCO2 per
year. If no country has been entered in the metadata then the default US
electricity emission factor is used. In each subcategory there is a
profile item value option for ***quantity***, this defaults to 1 if
nothing is entered by the user.
