The data in this category is sourced from the [Energy Star
website](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&pgw_code=PS).
This gives CO2 emissions for US appliances that have achieved the Energy
Star standard.

There are three drill-downs to be specified in this category:
***brandName***, ***modelName*** and ***modelNumber***. The user can
then specify a ***quantity*** of items as a profile item value. This
value defaults to 1 if none is entered by the user.

## Algorithm

CO2 = Energy usage of appliance per year \* US electricity emission
factor \* quantity
