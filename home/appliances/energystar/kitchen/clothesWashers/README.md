The data in this category is sourced from the [Energy Star
website](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=clotheswash.pr_clothes_washers).
This gives CO2 emissions for US appliances that have achieved the Energy
Star standard.

There are two drill-downs to be specified in this category: ***brand***
and ***model***. The user can then specify a ***quantity*** of items as
a profile item value. This value defaults to 1 if none is entered by the
user.

## Algorithm

CO2 = Energy usage of appliance per year \* US electricity emission
factor \* quantity
