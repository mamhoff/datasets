The data in this category is used to determine the emission factor to
apply to electrical device usage based on the country specified in the
metadata profile item, defaulting to the United Kingdom value if not
specified.

This is a duplicate of data in
[Electricity\_by\_country](Electricity_by_country); the only difference
is that this data is named using country
[ISO 3166](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/english_country_names_and_code_elements.htm)
codes.

The country value in the metadata profile item can be specified by two
letter ISO code.
