This data represents actions that result in reductions of CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions. These tips make broad assumptions about typical usage of
various items in the UK. Given detailed information from the user, it is
possible to generate more specific CO<sub>2</sub> reductions using data in
other categories. For example, if you know how many normal light bulbs a
user has, then the data in the [lighting](lighting) category can be used
to calculate the kgCO<sub>2</sub> reduction in changing all those lightbulbs to
low energy ones.
