This category contains data on the CO,,2,, intensity of electricity
supplied to the UK grid by specific providers. Annual values for
emissions intensity (i.e. kg CO,,2,, per kWh) are available for the
period 2005-2009

## Fuel mixes and reselling

The values fo *kg CO,,2,, per kWh* are based on the fuel mix of each
supplier. There is potential uncertainty with these figures in that they
do not account for the reselling of renewable energy. For example,
although *Good Energy* are undoubtedly more "green" than most other
suppliers, it is misleading to assign them the value of *0* *kg CO,,2,,
per kWh*.
