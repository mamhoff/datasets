This category contains CO<sub>2</sub> emissions factors for each electricity
generation method used to supply grid electricity. It is a look-up
category and so profile items should not be created inside it.

The ***kgCO2PerKWh*** figures give the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per kWh
generated. This does not necessarily equal the amount supplied to the
grid because some energy is used inside generation facilities. The
***generatedToSuppliedGrossFactor*** is the fraction of the generated
energy that is supplied to the grid.
[Real\_Time\_Electricity](Real_Time_Electricity) gives more detail on
this point.
