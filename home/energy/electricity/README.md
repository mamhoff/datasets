The data in this category is used to determine the emission factor to
apply to electrical device usage based on the country specified in

Emission factors are available for 136 countries and 15 global regions.

## Important

**Don't create profile items inside this category** - it's better to
create an item in the [/home/energy/quantity](Energy_by_Quantity)
category and set the country in the metadata item.
