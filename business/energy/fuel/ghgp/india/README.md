**Biomass combustion methodology. Calculates carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
emissions associated with the burning of biomass. Choices include wood,
straw, bamboo and waste. India.**

## Summary

This methodology represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the
combustion of biomass in India. The data is based upon the Greenhouse
Gas Protocol [customized
tool](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/files/ghgp/tools/India_Cement%20Tool-final.xls)
for cement produciton in India.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

This methodology is based upon emissions factors which represent the
rate at which emissions occur in relation to energy yielded by combusted
biomass. Multiplying a quantity of energy consumed by these emissions
factors results in an estimate of the emissions associated with that
quantity. The calculation assumes a 100% conversion from biomass carbon
to CO<sub>2</sub> during the combustion process.

The methodology also provides 'heating' or 'calorific' values for
biomass fuels. This enables the conversion of quantities of energy into
the corresponding mass of biomass fuel and therefore enables
calculations to made on the basis of the mass as well as energy
quantities.

### Model data

The emissions intensity of biomass varies according to its carbon
content (percent by weight), and, when expressed in relation to energy
yielded, the energy content. Therefore, 5 types of biomass are
represented, each, in-turn, represented by a characteristic CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions intensity, carbon content and calorific values.

### Activity data required

The quantity of biomass burned is required to make a calculation. This
can be specified as either a quantity of energy consumed or a mass of
biomass.

### Calculation and result

The quantity returned represents the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with
the state and the total quantity of energy specified. If values for the
'responsible' and 'total' areas are provided the returned value
represents just the emissions attributable to the area under
consdsideration.

## Notes

This methodology represents emissions of *biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>*. This means
that the CO<sub>2</sub> released was only removed from the atmosphere
relatively recently, during the growth of the biomass. In some contexts
this may mean that the emissions can be considered neutral with respect
to its effects on atmospheric carbon concentrations and warming.
