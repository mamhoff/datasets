**Grid electricity dataset. Describes the annual transmission losses
occuring within the primary distribution networks of the United
States.**

## Summary

This dataset describes the annual transmission losses which have
occurred within each primary distribution network (or 'grid') of the
United States. The data is sourced from the *[Emissions & Generation
Resource Integrated Database (eGRID2010,
version 1.1)](http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/index.html)*
published by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

This data enables conversions between electricity *supplied* to a grid,
and electricity *comsumed* by end users of that grid.

## The dataset

This data represents the annual transmission losses of the five separate
grids in the United States, for the calendar years 2004, 2005 and 2007.
In addition, the United States as a whole is represented.

Transmission losses are described as whole percentages (i.e. 0-100),
which represent the fraction of electricity supplied to the grid which
was lost in transmission during the period.

## Related methodologies

The broader EPA eGRID dataset provides emissions data and caluclation
methodologies aggregated into distinct geographic domains, including,
*eGRID* and *NERC* regions, 'power control areas', states and zip codes.
This dataset is employed within those methodologies for the purpose of
converting supply-based emissions intensities into consumed emissions
intensities.

More information on these datasets and calculation methodologies can be
found [here](US_E_grid).
