The AMEE category at */business/energy/electricity/china* includes data
for the emission of carbon dioxide during the production of grid
electricity for the different regions in China. It uses the most recent
emissions factors from the [Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
worksheets. These data are based on those from the "Notice of 2009
Emission Factors of regional power grid in China", Department of Climate
