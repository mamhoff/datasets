**Grid electricity methodology. Calculates carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
emissions associated with the generation of grid electricity by
country.**

## Summary

This methodology represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the the
production of grid electricity in specific countries and other
international jurisdictions. The data is sourced from the [Greenhouse
Gas Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
[worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) for
*GHG emissions from purchased electricity* (Version 2.1; published June
2009), based on data published by the International Energy Agency
[IEA](http://www.iea.org/index.asp).

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Electricity is produced by a variety of energy sources, including fossil
fuel combustion (coal, natural gas, oil), nuclear fission, and renewable
sources (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). These sources produce greenhouse
gases and other pollutants to differing extents. The specific
combination of generation types which supply a particular electricity
distribution network (or 'grid') therefore determines the emissions
intensity of the electricity delivered and consumed. This methodology
represents the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation
of grid electricity integrated across all generation types.

The methodology is based upon emissions factors which represent the rate
at which emissions occur in relation to quantities of electricity
generated. Multiplying a quantity of electricity generated by these
emissions factors results in an estimate of the emissions associated
with that quantity.

### Model data

The emissions intensity of oil-fired plants varies by geographic region.
154 distinct countries and other international jurisdictions are
described by time-series of historical annual emissions factors for
CO<sub>2</sub> (2000-2006).

### Activity data required

The quantity of electricity generated is required to make a calculation.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol worksheets additionally provide
functionality for the accounting of electricity usage in shared
facilities. This calculation is based on the proportion of floor area
which is under consideration (e.g. square feet of office space). In this
case the 'responsible' and 'total' areas should also be provided.

### Calculation and result

By default, the quantity returned represents the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
associated with the country/region and the total quantity of energy
specified. If values for the 'responsible' and 'total' areas are
provided the returned value represents just the emissions attributable
to the area under consdsideration.
