**Electricity disclosure for residual grid mixes in the Nordic
countries.**

## Summary

This dataset represents the data from the Electricity Disclosure for the
Residual Mixes 2010 for the Nordic countries based upon the **Nordic
domain**. This means that the mixes are calculated based on the physical
electricity production and exchange, as well as corrections of GOs and
similar products within the nordic region (Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
Finland).

Both Sweden and Finland calculate the Electricity Disclosure for the
Residual Mix on a Nordic domain however, Norway and Denmark both publish
their Residual Mixes on a national approach. This can thus be found
within the [national
domain](Nordic_Electricity_Disclosure_National_Domain) dataset.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

This methodology represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with grid
electricity use after taking into consideration the trading of GOs and
similar products, as well as national and international statistics for
electricity generation. This is known as the *Residual Mix* and the
objective of the introduction of the Residual Mix is to avoid double
counting within the various tracking systems.

The Residual Mix Calculations for the Nordic Countries is based on the
results from the RE-DISS (Reliable Disclosure Systems for Europe)
project ([RE-DISS](http://www.reliable-disclosure.org), 2010) as well as
recommendations based on the Energy Trading & Environment 2020 project
(2011).

### Model data

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the Nordic domain Electricity
Disclosure are based upon the *country* and *year*. Currently only data
for 2010 is available.

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensities are provided for the following electricity
generation types (in g/kWh)

  - Renewable

<!-- end list -->

  - Nuclear

<!-- end list -->

  - Fossil

<!-- end list -->

  - Total CO2 emissions intensity

-----

### Activity data required

Calculations are dependent on the amount of electricity consumed and
therefore this must be specified in order to calculate.

-----

### Calculation and results

The emissions calculated represent those attributable to the specified
quantity of electricity used. **CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated for
each type of electricity generation along with a total **CO<sub>2</sub>**
emissions value.

## Notes

The Definition of the Residual Mix (RE-DISS, 2010) is a set of
attributes for purposes of implicit tracking in electricity disclosure,
which has been determined by a Competent Body based on the attributes of
all electricity generation in one or several disclosure domains and
corrected by all attributes which have been allocated by other tracking
systems. Exports and imports of attributes, e.g. in the form of GO, also
have an impact on the Residual Mix.
