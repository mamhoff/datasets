**Electricity disclosure for residual grid mixes in the Nordic
countries.**

## Summary

This methodology represents the data from the Electricity Disclosure for
the Residual Mixes 2010 for the Nordic countries based upon a
**national** domain rather than the **Nordic** domain. This means that
the Residual Mix is calculated based on the physical electricity
production and exchange, as well as corrections of GOs and similar
products based upon an individual country rather than for a region such
as the **Nordic domain** which represents Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
Finland.

As such, the data contained in this methodology is equivalent to that
contained within the
[Residual-Mix](Nordic_Electricity_Residual_Mix_Disclosure_Nordic_Domain)
methodology. Both Sweden and Finland calculate the Electricity
Disclosure for the Residual Mix on a Nordic domain however, Norway and
Denmark both publish their Residual Mixes on a national approach.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

This methodology represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with grid
electricity use after taking into consideration the trading of GOs and
similar products, as well as national and international statistics for
electricity generation. This is known as the *Residual Mix* and the
objective of the introduction of the Residual Mix is to avoid double
counting within the various tracking systems.

The Residual Mix Calculations for the Nordic Countries is based on the
results from the RE-DISS (Reliable Disclosure Systems for Europe)
project ([RE-DISS](http://www.reliable-disclosure.org), 2010) as well as
recommendations based on the Energy Trading & Environment 2020 project
(2011).

### Model data

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the National domain Electricity
Disclosure are based upon the *country* and *year*. Currently only data
for 2010 is available.

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensities are provided for the following electricity
generation types (in g/kWh)

  - Renewable

<!-- end list -->

  - Nuclear

<!-- end list -->

  - Fossil

<!-- end list -->

  - Total CO2 emissions intensity

### Activity data required

Calculations are dependent on the quantity of electricity consumed and
therefore this must be specified in order to calculate.

-----

### Calculation and results

The emissions calculated represent those attributable to the specified
quantity of electricity used. **CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated for
each type of electricity generation along with a total **CO<sub>2</sub>**
emissions value.

## Notes

The Danish (Energinet, 2011) Residual Mix 2010 â€“ based on the RE-DISS
data and a national domain (some national adjustments have been done).
