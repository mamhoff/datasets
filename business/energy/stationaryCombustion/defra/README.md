The UK government Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes greenhouse gas emissions methodologies for the stationary
combustion of fuels for producing energy.

These methodologies are accompanied by data which represent the unit
emissions for energy-based, mass-based or volumetric measures of fuel,
and, in each case, differentiate 'direct', 'indirect', and 'total' or
'life cycle' emissions.

For further details, see the following subcategories:

  - [Fuel combustion based on energy
    quantities](Energy_based_fuel_combustion_by_DEFRA)
  - [Fuel combustion based on mass
    quantities](Mass_based_fuel_combustion_by_DEFRA)
  - [Fuel combustion based on volumetric
    quantities](Volume_based_fuel_combustion_by_DEFRA)
  - [Physical properties of fossil- and
    biofuels](Fuel_properties_by_DEFRA)
