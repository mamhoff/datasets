**Volume based stationary combustion of fuels. Calculates direct,
indirect and life cycle carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>),
nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e)
emissions associated with fuel combustion on the basis of the volume
combusted.**

## Summary

This methodology represents greenhouse gas emissions associated with the
stationary combustion of fuels as measured on the basis of *fuel
volume*. The data and calculation methodology originates from the UK
government department DEFRA, as published in their most recent
[greenhouse gas (GHG) conversion
factors](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting)
documentation.

## The methodology

The emissions calculation methodology is based upon emissions factors
which relate a volume-based quantity of fuel, with its associated
quantity of greenhouse gas emissions. These values vary, depending on
factors such as the concentration of carbon and moisture within each
fuel type.

## Model data

Each fuel type is represented by six distinct emissions factors, which
differentiate greenhouse gas emissions into the following types:

  - '*direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*': carbon dioxide emissions produced
    *during* fuel combustion
  - '*direct CH<sub>4</sub> emissions*': methane emissions produced *during*
    fuel combustion
  - '*direct N<sub>2</sub>O emissions*': nitrous oxide emissions produced
    *during* fuel combustion
  - '*total direct emissions*': sum of all direct emissions, i.e.
    CO<sub>2</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O
  - '*indirect emissions*': emissions associated with stages in the fuel
    production chain such as raw material extraction and fuel delivery
  - '*life cycle emissions*': the total of direct and indirect emissions

## Activity data required

Calculations are based on the **volume** used during combustion of the
chosen type of **fuel**.

## Calculation and result

The following quantities are calculated on the basis of the amount of
mass combusted and associated emission factors: **CO<sub>2</sub>**,
**CH<sub>4</sub>**, **N<sub>2</sub>O**, **total direct CO<sub>2</sub>e**, **full life cycle
CO<sub>2</sub>e**.

Users should note that **all quantities** (including the separated
CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions) are expressed in terms of
**[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials)** - the
quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> that would exert the same atmospheric warming effect
and the emissions quantity.

## Notes

### Renewable Fuel Considerations

Separate Emission factors are provided for diesel, petrol, a
diesel+biodiesel blend (= 4.2% by unit mass, 4.0% by unit volume, 3.7%
by unit energy), and a petrol+bioethanol blend (= 3.1% by unit mass,
2.9% by unit volume, 1.9% by unit energy). Blended fuel emission factors
are a weighted average of those respective fuels provided at UK public
refuelling stations as a proportion of the total supply. These estimates
have been made based on the most recently available reports on the
Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO).
