The AMEE category /business/energy/stationaryCombustion/epa contains
data on the burning of fossil fuels sourced from the US Environmental
Protection Agency's [Climate Leaders](Climate_Leaders) initiative. These
calculation methodologies correspond to the *Tier 1* approach described
by the technical guidelines for the EPA's mandatory greenhouse gas
reporting
[rule](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ghgrulemaking.html).

This category is organised into several subcategories representing the
burning of coal, natural gas, petroleum-derived fuels and wood. In each
case, calculations of CO,,2,, emissions associated with the burning of
fuel can be made based on either the quantity of energy or physical
amount of fuel (i.e. mass or volume, as appropriate) consumed.

Users have the option of incorporating CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions
into their calculations. Since these emissions depend on the combustion
context, users requiring these emissions must additionally specific this
context (e.g. 'residential', 'commercial', 'industry', 'electricity
generation'). These emissions are based on the data in
[this](CH4_and_N20_emissions_from_stationary_combustion) lookup
sub-category.
