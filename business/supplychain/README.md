This section allows users to estimate emissions from the supply chain of
a variety of Products. The data is based on the most recent [Defra
conversion
factors](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting).
The emission factors used in this category cover *indirect* emissions
from the supply chain only and include contributions from CO<sub>2</sub>,
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, HFCs, PFCs and SF<sub>6</sub>. Therefore, these factors are
unlike most emission factors, which deal with *direct* emissions.

## Emission Factor Origin

This category is intended for use as a high-level diagnostic tool and is
not a replacement for more specific information if available.

The emission factors here are based on the amount spent (in pounds
sterling excluding VAT) on each group of products and include the raw
material extraction, processing, manufacturing, transportation and
packaging. These factors are derived from a multi-region model, so take
some account of emissions relating to imported goods. The results
derived here can be combined with direct emission calculations (e.g.
those relating to actual fuel use) to provide full life-cycle emissions.

The factors are based on a model of the economy, known as the
input-output model, which describes in monetary terms how the goods and
services produced by different sectors of the economy are used by other
sectors to produce their own output. These monetary accounts are linked
to information about the greenhouse gas emissions of different sectors
of the economy. By using the input-output model, these emissions are
then attributed to the monetary transactions taking place in the
economy. The result is an estimate of the total upstream emissions
associated with the supply of a particular product group. The
input-output tables used here are in 2006 basic prices; therefore, it
will be advisable to take subsequent price changes into account when
using this category. Changes in the supply chain since this time should
also be taken into account.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

Use the drill-down ***productCategory*** to chose the product type you
wish to calculate emissions for.

### Specifying activity data

The ***amountSpent***, in pounds sterling, must then be set as a profile
item value.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent the greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the quantities and refrigerant type specified. The
following quantities are returned:

  - ***CO2***: quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  - ***ch4CO2e***: quantity of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions expressed in terms of
    CO<sub>2</sub>e
  - ***n2oCO2e***: quantity of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions expressed in terms of
    CO<sub>2</sub>e
  - ***hfcCO2e***: quantity of HFC emissions expressed in terms of
    CO<sub>2</sub>e
  - ***pfcCO2e***: quantity of PFC emissions expressed in terms of
    CO<sub>2</sub>e
  - ***sf6CO2e***: quantity of SF<sub>6</sub> emissions expressed in terms of
    CO<sub>2</sub>e
  - ***totalCO2e***: total, combined CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions

## Notes

### CO<sub>2</sub>e quantities

Emissions in this methodology are pre-converted into
[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials). These
conversions are not made by AMEE.
