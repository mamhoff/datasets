The AMEE category /business/waste/combustion contains data and
methodologies sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/5_Volume5/V5_5_Ch5_IOB.pdf)
for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the burning of
waste.

The data is organised into three subcategories, as follows:

  - [/business/waste/combustion/municipal](Municipal_waste_combustion):
    contains data and a methodology for calculating ''municipal waste''
    emissions organised by waste type

<!-- end list -->

  - [/business/waste/combustion/industrial](Industrial_waste_combustion):
    contains data and a methodology for calculating ''industrial waste''
    emissions organised by industrial sector

<!-- end list -->

  - [/business/waste/combustion/other](Other_waste_combustion): contains
    data and a methodology for calculating emissions for several other
    industrial waste types

These categories represent specific types or instances of waste
combustion. For waste combustion emissions calculations based on
aggregated, generic waste types (bulked municipal and industrial wastes)
users are referred to the AMEE category
[/business/energy/stationaryCombustion](Stationary_Combustion).
