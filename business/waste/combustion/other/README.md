The AMEE category /business/waste/combustion/other contains data and
methodologies sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/5_Volume5/V5_5_Ch5_IOB.pdf)
for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the burning of
several generic types of industrial waste ('industrial', 'clinical',
'sewage sludge', 'fossil liquids').

CO,,2,, which derives from recently sequestered carbon sources and
fossil sources are differentiated, since their net impact on atmospheric
CO,,2,, concentrations in distinct.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

To use this category, select the waste type using the *type* drill
choice.

### Specifying activity data

Next, set the quantity of waste burned using the ***mass*** profile item
value. The mass of waste should reflect the dry mass in all cases except
the 'fossil liquid waste' drill choice in which case the mass represents
wet weight.

### Results and calculation

The values returned represent CO,,2,, emissions associated with the
waste quantity specified. The following discrete values are returned:

  - ***fossilCO2***: CO,,2,, emissions which derived from fossil carbon
  - ***biogenicCO2***: CO,,2,, emissions which derived from recently
    sequestered, biogenic carbon
  - ***totalCO2***: fossil *and* biogenic carbon
