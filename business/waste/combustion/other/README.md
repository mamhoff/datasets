The AMEE category /business/waste/combustion/other contains data and
methodologies sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/5_Volume5/V5_5_Ch5_IOB.pdf)
for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the burning of
several generic types of industrial waste ('industrial', 'clinical',
'sewage sludge', 'fossil liquids').

CO<sub>2</sub> which derives from recently sequestered carbon sources and
fossil sources are differentiated, since their net impact on atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in distinct.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

To use this category, select the waste type using the *type* drill
choice.

### Specifying activity data

Next, set the quantity of waste burned using the ***mass*** profile item
value. The mass of waste should reflect the dry mass in all cases except
the 'fossil liquid waste' drill choice in which case the mass represents
wet weight.

### Results and calculation

The values returned represent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the
waste quantity specified. The following discrete values are returned:

  - ***fossilCO2***: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which derived from fossil carbon
  - ***biogenicCO2***: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which derived from recently
    sequestered, biogenic carbon
  - ***totalCO2***: fossil *and* biogenic carbon
