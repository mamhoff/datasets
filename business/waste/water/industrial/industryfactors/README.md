The AMEE category at /business/waste/water/industrial/industryfactors
contains data on typical waste water characteristics of specific
industries: (1) the typical volume of waste water associated with each
unit mass of production in each industry; and (2) the typical
concentration of degradable organic matter within the waste water of
each industry.

This category is used as a lookup reference for the category at
[/business/waste/water/industrial](Industrial_waste_water) and should
not be used to create profile items.
