The AMEE category /business/waste/water contains data and methodologies
for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste water,
sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/5_Volume5/V5_6_Ch6_Wastewater.pdf)
and the
[EPA](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/archived/downloads/tsd/TSD%20wastewater_020409.pdf)
mandatory reporting guidelines.

Several subcategories are available at the following locations:

  - [/business/waste/water/domestic](Domestic_waste_water)

<!-- end list -->

  - [/business/waste/water/industrial](Industrial_waste_water)

These categories calculate methane emissions associated with waste water
based on the concentration of degradable organic material within the
water (as measured by the biological or chemical oxygen demand) and the
discharge pathway/treatment system. See the respective subcategories for
further details.

  - [Anaerobic digestion](Waste_water_treatment_anaerobic_digestion):
    this category enables the calculation of the quantity of methane
    from anaerobic digesters which is combusted at water treatment
    plants.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Nitrous oxide (N,,2,,O)](Waste_water_treatment_N2O): this category
    provides a methodology for calculating the N,,2,,O emissions from
    water treatment plants based on details of the service population.
