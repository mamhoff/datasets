This category contains data on the greenhouse gases - or groups of
greenhouse gases - which are typically emitted in association with
particular industrial processes. The advice originates from the UK
government department DEFRA, as published in their most recent
[greenhouse gas (GHG) conversion
factors](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting)
documentation.

The information relates specifically to processes in operation in the UK
and emissions may differ slightly in other jurisdictions.

## Note

### Limstone use

The 'limestone use' option refers to usage of limestone in Flue Gas
Desulphurisation (FGD) and processes such as those in the glass
industry. Not all uses of limestone release CO,,2,,.

### Fletton brick manufacture

The 'fletton brick manufacture' option is specific to Fletton brick
manufacture at the mineral processing stage, a process that uses clay
with high organic content. Other types of brick manufacturing in the UK
do not release Greenhouse Gases during the processing stage.
