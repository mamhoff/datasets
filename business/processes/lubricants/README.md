**Non energy products emissions methodology, lubricants. Calculates
carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions based on the quantity of lubricant
used. Scenarios include lubricating oil and grease. Globally
applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions
associated with the use of **industrial lubricants**. The data and
calculation methodology are sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as published
in *[Volume 3, Chapter 5 - Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent
Use](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_5_Ch5_Non_Energy_Products.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

In addition to their uses as fuels (for heat and energy), and industrial
feedstocks and reducing agents, fossil fuels can also form the basis of
lubricant products which are used in industrial and transportation
applications. The use of fossil fuels as lubricants can result in the
emission of CO<sub>2</sub> as some or all of the fossil carbon (C) is oxidised
unintentionally, e.g. co-combustion of a fraction of lubricants that
slips into the combustion chamber of an engine.

This methodology enables the calculation of such emissions on the basis
of an emissions factor derived from several quantities which represent
the physical and chemical properties of the processes involved.
Multiplying a quantity of lubricant used by these emissions factors
results in an estimate of the emissions associated with that quantity.

This methodology represents the IPCC *tier 1* (aggregated lubricant
types) and *tier 2* (differentiated types) approaches.

### Model data

Three scenarios are represented in this methodology: *lubricating oil*
(i.e. motor/industrial oils), *grease* and an *aggregated* option. The
latter scenario represents the weighted (and rounded) average emissions
of both lubricating oils and grease combined according to their typical
relative usages as stated by the IPCC (oil, 90%; grease, 10%).

For each scenario, the following values are provided for deriving the
appropriate emissions factor:

  - *mass of carbon per energy yielded*: this is a measure of the carbon
    content of the lubricant

<!-- end list -->

  - *net calorific value*: this also called the 'lower heating value'
    and represents the energy content per mass of lubricant

<!-- end list -->

  - *typical fraction oxidised during use (ODU)*: the typical proportion
    which is oxidised during use

Also used in the deriviation of emissions factors is the ratio of the
molecular mass of CO<sub>2</sub> (44) and the atomic mass of C (12).

These values are combined into an emissions factor in the follwing ways:

1.  energy-based emissions factor = mass of carbon per energy x ODU x
    molecular/atomic mass ratio
2.  mass-based emissions factor = energy-based emissions factor x net
    calorific value

### Activity data required

Greenhouse gas emissions are directly proportionate to the quantity of
lubricant used. This quantity can be provided based on either **mass**
or **energy**, as indicated by equations 1 and 2 above.

### Calculation and results

**CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated by simply multiplying the specified
quantity by the appropriate emissions factor. These emissions represent
those attributable to the specified quantity used.

## Additional information

### Methodology scope

According to the IPCC, only a small proportion of lubricants typically
oxidises during use and the main contribution to atmospheric greenhouse
gas emissions is when the waste lubricants are collected at the end of
their use and combusted. This methodology represent only the emissions
associated with the *use* stage, and disposal emissions should be
addressed using an appropriate methodology for combustion or waste
diposal (see below).

### Heating values

The lower heating values which are used for converting energy-based
quantities into mass quantities are sourced from *Volume 2, Chapter 1*
([Introduction, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_1_Ch1_Introduction.pdf))
of the same publication.
