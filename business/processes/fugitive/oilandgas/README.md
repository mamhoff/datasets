**Fugitive emissions methodology, underground mining. Calculates carbon
dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)
emissions based on the quantity of oil or gas processed. Scenarios
include drilling, production, transport, storage, refining, flaring and
venting. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>), **methane**
(CH<sub>4</sub>) and **nitrous oxide** (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions associated with the
**production, processing and transport of oil and gas**. The data and
calculation methodology are sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as published
in *[Volume 2, Chapter 4 - Fugitive
Emissions](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_4_Ch4_Fugitive_Emissions.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

The extraction, processing, storage and transport of oil and gas is
associated with fugitive emissions from a number of sources including -
but are not limited to - equipment leaks, evaporation and flashing
losses, venting, flaring, incineration and accidental releases (e.g.
well blow-outs and spills). This methodology enables the calculation of
such fugitive emissions based on emissions factors which describe the
rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted in relation to the quantity
(volume) of oil or gas processed (i.e. kg per m^^3^^). Multiplying a
quantity of oil or gas processed by these emissions factors results in
an estimate of the fugitive emissions associated with that quantity and
process.

This methodology represents the IPCC *tier 1* approach and assumes that,
in the case of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, hydrocarbons are fully oxidised.

### Model data

Rates of fugitive emissions vary depending on the specific process
undertaken as well as a number of other factors. As such 153 oil and gas
processing scenarios are represented in this methodology, differentiated
on the basis of processing **type** (e.g. *gas processing*, *oil
production*, *well drilling*) and **subtype** (e.g. *deep-cut
extraction*, *sour gas plants*, *thermal oil production*), **emission
source** (e.g. *flaring*, *raw CO2 venting*) and **geographic context**
(e.g. *developed countries*, *developing countries*). In some cases the
IPCC documentation describes emissions factors in terms of a range of
values and, as such, these can be differentiated between *upper*,
*lower* or *mean* scenarios - the mean option represents the midpoint of
the upper and lower estimates.

Each processing scenario is represented by up to three emissions factors
representing the emissions of **CO<sub>2</sub>**, **CH<sub>4</sub>** and **N<sub>2</sub>O**
associated with unit volumes processed.

In addition to the process-specific emissions factors, the *global
warming potentials* of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O are also used in order to
convert absolute emissions quantities into
[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials) quantities - i.e.
the quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> which would exert the same atmospheric warming
effect.

### Activity data required

Greenhouse gas emissions are directly proportionate to the **volume** of
oil or gas processed, which therefore must be provided in order to
calculate.

### Calculation and results

Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated by simply multiplying the
specified volumes by the appropriate emissions factors for the process
under consideration.

Up to four emissions quantities are ultimately provided, representing:
**CO<sub>2</sub>**, **CH<sub>4</sub>**, **N<sub>2</sub>O** and **total CO<sub>2</sub>e** emissions.
For some processes, only a subset of these gases is appropriate and
therefore calculated accordingly.

All emissions calculated by this methodology represent those
attributable to the specified quantity processed.

## Additional information

### Nomenclature

**'Fugitive emissions':** The term fugitive emissions is broadly applied
in this context to represent all greenhouse gas emissions from oil and
gas systems except contributions from fuel combustion.

**'Oil and gas systems':** Oil and natural gas systems comprise all
infrastructure required to produce, collect, process or refine and
deliver natural gas and petroleum products to market. The system begins
at the well head, or oil and gas source, and ends at the final sales
point to the consumer. Fugitive emissions occuring outside of this
system (e.g. by other industrial facility operations or waste disposal
activities), and emissions associated with fuel combustion for heat or
energy, are not considered in this methodology.

### Methodology scope

The data provided within this methodology represents oil and gas
processing in both 'developed' and 'developing' country contexts.
However, the IPCC advise that this methodology is suitable for
"...systems designed, operated and maintained to North American and
Western European standards".

### Default units

The data provided herein has been standardised to units of kg
\[emissions\] per m^^3^^. The IPCC source documentation provides these
data in a mixture of units, including Gg per 10^^3^^ m^^3^^ and Gg per
10^^6^^ m^^3^^.
