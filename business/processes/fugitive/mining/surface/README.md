**Fugitive emissions methodology, surface mining. Calculates methane
(CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions based on the quantity of coal produced. Globally
applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **methane** (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions associated
with the **surface mining of coal**. The data and calculation
methodology are sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as published in
*[Volume 2, Chapter 4 - Fugitive
Emissions](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_4_Ch4_Fugitive_Emissions.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Fugitive emissions of greenhouse gases can arise during the surficial
mining of coal through several pathways:

  - *Mining emissions*: CH<sub>4</sub> emissions result from the liberation of
    gases during the breakage of coal and surrounding strata during
    mining operations

<!-- end list -->

  - *Post-mining emissions*: CH<sub>4</sub> is additionally released from coal
    during processing and transportation

<!-- end list -->

  - *Low temperature oxidation*: CO<sub>2</sub> is produced by the oxidation of
    coal carbon (C) on exposure to oxygen

<!-- end list -->

  - *Uncontrolled oxidation*: CO<sub>2</sub> is produced during the
    uncontrolled burning of coal. This may occur as a consequence of the
    trapping of heat produced by low temperature oxidation.

Only the first two sources of emissions are considered in this
methodology: low temperature oxidation is typically insignificant
(especially where rehabilitation practices are employed); uncontrolled
oxidation is sometimes significant but extremely difficult to quantify.

This methodology calculates mining and post-mining associated CH<sub>4</sub>
emissions based on emissions factors which describe the rate at which
CH<sub>4</sub> is released in relation to the quantity of coal produced (in
terms of mass, i.e. tonnes). By multiplying these rates (e.g. m^^3^^ per
tonne) by the annual quantity of coal produced (e.g. tonne per year), an
estimate of the annual methane emissions - by volume (i.e. m^^3^^ per
year) - is made. This is converted to a mass quantity using the standard
value for CH<sub>4</sub> density provided by the IPCC guidelines.

### Model data

The rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is released depends on the depth of the
material (e.g. rock, soil) overburden. Emissions factors are provided
for three overburden depth ranges (*\<25 m*, *25-50 m*, *\>50 m*). Each
depth range is represented by:

  - A *mining* phase emissions factor (m^^3^^ per tonne)

<!-- end list -->

  - A *post-mining* phase emission factor (m^^3^^ per tonne)

The methodology also uses two additional values for making the final
emissions calculations

  - A standard value for the *density of CH<sub>4</sub>* (0.67 tonnes per
    m^^3^^) which enables the conversion of volumetric to mass-based
    emissions

<!-- end list -->

  - The *global warming potential of CH<sub>4</sub>* which enables the
    conversion of absolute CH<sub>4</sub> emissions into a
    [CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials) quantity -
    i.e. the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> which would exert the same atmospheric
    warming effect

### Activity data required

Greenhouse gas emissions are directly proportionate to the **mass** of
coal produced annually, which therefore must be provided in order to
calculate.

### Calculation and results

Both mining and post-mining CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are calculated and
aggregated. Two emissions quantities are ultimately provided,
representing: **CH<sub>4</sub>** and **CO<sub>2</sub>e** emissions.

All emissions calculated by this methodology represent those
attributable to the specified annual quantity of coal production.
