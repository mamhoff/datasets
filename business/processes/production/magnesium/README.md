The AMEE category business/processes/production/magnesium contains data
and methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated
with magnesium production. See the appropriate subcategories for further
details.

### Primary magnesium production

The AMEE category
[business/processes/production/magnesium/primaryproduction](Magnesium_primary_production)
contains a methodology based on default emission factors for use in
situations where facility or site-specific data is not available and
represents the *Tier 1* (default values) and *Tier 2* (facility- or
country-specific values) approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

### Casting processes

The AMEE category
[business/processes/production/magnesium/castingprocess](Magnesium_casting_process)
contains a methodology for calculating SF,,6,, emissions from the
magnesium casting process segment. The methodology provided by this
category represents the *Tier 1* (default values) and *Tier 2*
(facility- or country-specific values) approaches described by the IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
