**Paper industry methodology, pulping liquors. Calculates carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions associated with the combustion of pulping liquors.
Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions
associated with the combustion of spent pulping liquors. The data and
calculation methodology is sourced from the sourced from the guidelines
published by the International Council of Forest and Paper Associations
([ICFPA](http://www.wbcsd.org/web/projects/forestry/Pulp-and-Paper-Tool-Guidance.pdf)).

## The methodology

### Emissions model

This methodology is based upon a basic mass-balance approach which
considers the quantity of carbon which is oxidised during the combustion
of pulping liquors. This quantity is derived from a simple
multiplication of the quantity of pulping liquor (mass), its carbon
content (fraction by mass) and the fraction undergoing complete
oxidation (decimal fraction). This quantity of carbon is then converted
into its corresponding quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> using the known ratio of
their respective atomic/molecular masses.

The methodology also provides 'heating' or 'calorific' values for
biomass fuels. This enables the conversion of quantities of energy into
the corresponding mass of biomass fuel and therefore enables
calculations to made on the basis of energy consumed as well as mass of
biomass.

### Model data

The emissions intensity of pulping liquors varies according to their
carbon content (percent by weight), and, when expressed relation to
energy yielded, their energy content. Therefore, 9 types of pulping
liquor are represented, differentiated in terms of the wood type from
which they were derived. Each is, in-turn, represented by a
characteristic carbon content and both gross and net calorific values.

A default oxidation factor of 0.99 (99%) is provided.

### Activity data required

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are directly proportionate to the **quantity of
pulping liquor consumed**, which therefore must be provided in order to
calculate. Quantities can be expressed in terms of mass or energy. When
calculating using energetic quantities, the basis of the energy quantity
- net or gross - can be stipulated.

### Calculation and results

**CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated by simply multiplying the specified
quantity of pulping liquor consumed by the carbon content, oxidation and
stoichiometric factors. By default, energy-based activity data is
considered to represent the *net* calorific basis. These emissions
represent those attributable to the specified quantity of pulping liquor
consumed.

## Notes

This methodology represents emissions of biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. This means
that the CO<sub>2</sub> released was only removed from the atmosphere
relatively recently, during the growth of the biomass. In some contexts
this may mean that the emissions can be considered neutral with respect
to its effects on atmoshperic carbon concentrations and warming.
