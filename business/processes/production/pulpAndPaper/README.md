This category provides data and a methodology for calculating greenhouse
gas emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing. These methodologies and
their associated data are sourced from the WRI Greenhouse Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) but
ultimately follow the methodology published by the [Climate Change
Working
Group](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/downloads/calcs/Pulp_and_Paper_Guidance.pdf)
of The International Council of Forest and Paper Associations (ICFPA).

Direct emissions from the manufacture of pulp and paper can be
calculated using the [direct emissions](Pulp_and_Paper_Direct_Emissions)
subcategory. Users should be aware that emissions from the stationary
combustion of fuels in the paper industry can be established using the
AMEE [stationary combustion](Stationary_Combustion) category.

Emissions arising from the combustion of biomass can be calculated using
the [biomass emissions](Pulp_and_paper_biomass_emissions) category. This
calculation considers the CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions from a variety
of biomass scenarios.

To calculate the biogenic CO,,2,, emissions associated with the burning
of pulping liquors, users can use the [pulping liquor
consumption](Pulping_liquor_consumption) category.
