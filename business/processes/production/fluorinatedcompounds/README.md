The AMEE category at business/processes/production/fluorinatedcompounds
provides a methodology for calculating emissions of fluorinated
compounds (FC) associated with their production. See the following
subcategories for further details.

### Production-based methodology

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/fluorinatedcompounds](Generic_fluorinated_compound_production)
provides a methodology for calculating emissions of fluorinated
compounds (FC) associated with their production, based on default
emissions factors relating to the production of HFC's, PFC's and
SF,,6,,. Users have the option of returning absolute quantity of
emissions, or - by specifying the particular type of FC fluid used -
returning the emissions expressed as CO,,2,,e. This methodology
represents the *Tier 1* approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
