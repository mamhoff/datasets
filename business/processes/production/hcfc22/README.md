This category provides data and calculation methodologies for estimating
greenhouse gas emissions from the production of chlorodifluoromethane
(HCFC-22). These methodologies and their associated data are sourced
from the WRI Greenhouse Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) but
ultimately follow the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html).
They cover only process-related HFC-23 emissions arising from the
production of HCFC-22; it does not cover direct emissions from the
combustion of fossil fuel or indirect emissions from the purchase of
energy.

Three methods are presented in the related subcategories:

  - A methodology using [gas stream](HCFC22_gas_stream) data,
    repesenting the IPCC *Tier 3* approach
  - A methodology using [fluorine and
    carbon](HCFC22_fluorine_and_carbon) balance efficiency data,
    repesenting the IPCC *Tier 2* approach
  - A methodology using [default](HCFC22_production_data_only) data,
    repesenting the IPCC *Tier 1* approach
