This category provides a calculation methodology for estimating
greenhouse gas emissions from the production of chlorodifluoromethane
(HCFC-22), and is specifically applicable if [gas stream
methodology](HCFC22_gas_stream) or [fluorine and
carbon](HCFC22_fluorine_and_carbon) balance efficiency data are not
available.

The methodology and associated data are sourced from the WRI Greenhouse
Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) but
ultimately follow the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)
where it represents the *Tier 1* methodology. It covers only
process-related HFC-23 emissions arising from the production of HCFC-22;
it does not cover direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuel or
indirect emissions from the purchase of energy.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

Use the drill-down ***type*** to select the type of plant.

### Specifying activity data

The profile item values listed below are then required from the user.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent the greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the specified inputs. Two quantities are returned, as
follows:

  - ***HFC23***: absolute quantity of HFC-23 emissions for the quantity
    specified
  - ***CO2e***: CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions (absolute emissions converted using
    the appropriate [global warming
    potential](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials))
