The AMEE category /business/processes/production/glass contains data and
methodologies for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions associated
with the production of glass. Two subcategories are currently available,
which provide two methodologies sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The [Generic glass production](Generic_glass_production) category
provides data for the manufacture of generic, representative type of
glass.

The [Glass production carbonate
methodology](Glass_production_carbonate_methodology) category uses
specific quantities of various carbonate species - used as feedstock in
the glass industry and the primary source of carbon - for calculating
CO,,2,, emissions.
