AMEE provides two methodologies for calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
associated with the production of cement sourced from the WRI Greenhouse
Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

  - [CSI](Cement_CSI) - a clinker-based methodology based on the Cement
    Sustainability Initiative (CSI) guidelines

<!-- end list -->

  - [EPA](Cement_EPA) - an methodology based on carbonate inputs sourced
    from the US EPA's ClimateWise program

<!-- end list -->

  - [IPCC](IPCC_cement_methodologies) - three methodologies based on
    cement production, clinker produciton and carbonate inputs sourced
    from the IPCC-NGGIP
