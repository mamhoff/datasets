This category provides data and a calculation methodology for greenhouse
gas emissions associated with the production of cement using the
clinker-based information. This methodology is based on guidelines
provided by the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and used in the
WRI Greenhouse Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) for
cement industry greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is consistent
with guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories issued by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

There are no drill-down options for this category; the required profile
item values are listed below.

## Algorithm

***Clinker CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*** = *EF \* clinker quantity*

***Bypass dust CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*** = *EF \* bypass dust quantity*

***CKD CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*** = *(CKD quantity \* EF) / (1 + EF) \*
(calcination CKD/100) / (1 - EF / (1 + EF) \* (calcination CKD/100))*

***CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*** = *(carbon content/100) \* raw clinker ratio \*
clinker quantity \* (44 / 12)*

AMEE returns the sum of the above. The CO<sub>2</sub> produced is found from
the carbon content of materials the CO<sub>2</sub> molecular mass : carbon
atomic mass ratio, 44/12.
