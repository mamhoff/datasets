This category allows the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from
the production of cement using the cement-based methodology. This method
is based on the U.S. EPA's ClimateWise program (ICF 1999).

Use the drill-down cement ***type*** and enter the profile item values
listed below in order to calculate the emissions for the selected cement

## Algorithm

***CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*** = *cement quantity \* clinker content \* raw
material quantity \* CaCO3 ratio \* 0.44*

The factor 0.44 is the CO<sub>2</sub> to CaCO3 stoichiometric ratio.
