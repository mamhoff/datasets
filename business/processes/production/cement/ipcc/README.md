The AMEE category /business/processes/production/cement/ipcc contains
several methodologies sourced from the the IPCC guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_2_Ch2_Mineral_Industry.pdf))
related to the production of cement.

### Cement production-based methodology

The AMEE category
[business/processes/production/cement/ipcc/cement](IPCC_cement_production_based_on_production)
provides a methodology based on the quantity of cement produced and
represents the *Tier 1* approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
This methodology should be used where no information on clinker
production or the consumption of raw carbonate materials are available.
The methodology estimates emissions from the production of clinker based
on data describing production of cement together with default values
representing typical cement properties.

### Clinker production-based methodology

The AMEE category
[business/processes/production/cement/ipcc/clinker](IPCC_cement_production_based_on_clinker)
provides a methodology based on the quantity and properties of clinker
produced and represents the *Tier 2* approach described by the IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
This methodology should be used where no information on the consumption
of raw carbonate materials are available, but data on clinker production
is available.

### Carbonate inputs-based methodology

The AMEE category
[business/processes/production/cement/ipcc/carbonate](IPCC_cement_production_based_on_carbonate_inputs)
provides a methodology using specific quantities of various carbonate
species - the primary source of carbon - for calculating CO,,2,,
emissions, and represents the *Tier 3* approach described by the IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
