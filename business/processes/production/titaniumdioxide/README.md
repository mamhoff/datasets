The AMEE category at /business/processes/production/titaniumdioxide
provides methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production of titanium dioxide. See the following
subcategories for further details.

### Generic calculation

The AMEE category at
[/business/processes/production/lime/production/titaniumdioxide/production](Generic_titanium_dioxide_production)
provides a methodology based upon generic emissions factors for CO,,2,,
emissions per quantity of titanium oxide produced. This methodology
represents the *Tier 1* approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

### Feedstock-based calculation

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/titaniumdioxide/consumption](Titanium_dioxide_production_feedstock_methodology)
provides a methodology based on a mass-balance approach taking into
consideration the carbon content of process feedstocks. This methodology
is sourced from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)) and
represents the *Tier 2* approach.
