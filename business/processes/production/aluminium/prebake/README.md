AMEE provides two methodologies for calculating emissions from aluminium
manufacture using the prebake process.

  - [Prebake (electrolysis)](Aluminium_prebake_electrolysis) - this
    category provides data and two calculation methodologies for CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions from prebake cells (Centre-Worked Prebake (CWPB),
    Side-Worked Prebake (SWPB)). This category represents *Tiers 2 and
    3* approach under the IPCC guideliines.

  - [Prebake (pitch cooking)](Aluminium_prebake_pitchcooking) - this
    category provides data and two calculation methodologies for CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions relating to *pitch volatiles combustion* and *bake furnace
    paking material*. This category represents *Tiers 2 and 3* under the
    IPCC guideliines.

Both methodologies need to be used in order to estimate total CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions from the prebake process.
