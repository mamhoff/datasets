Methodologies relating to perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions from
electrolysis in the aluminium industry are available at the following
AMEE categories:

  - [Default PFC methodology](Aluminium_PFC_Defaults) - this category
    provides a calculation methodology for CF,,4,, and C,,2,,F,,6,,
    emissions using default emissions factors. This category represents
    the *Tier 1* approach under the IPCC guidelines.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Overvoltage PFC methodology](Aluminium_PFC_Overvoltage) - this
    category provides a calculation methodology for CF,,4,, and
    C,,2,,F,,6,, emissions based on data describing aluminium production
    and anode effect minutes per cell day. This methodology represents
    *Tier 2 and 3* approaches for PFC emissions under IPCC guidelines.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Slope PFC methodology](Aluminium_PFC_Slope) - this category
    provides a calculation methodology for CF,,4,, and C,,2,,F,,6,,
    emissions based on anode effect overvoltage data. This methodology
    represents *Tier 2 and 3* approaches for PFC emissions under IPCC
    guidelines.

The Slope and Overvoltage methodologies can be used using either of the
following cases:

  - IPCC *Tier 3* method - If direct measurements of CF,,4,, and
    C,,2,,F,,6,, have been made at smelters, potline or smelter specific
    correlations between PFC emissions and anode effect parameters (AEM
    or AEO) can be developed.

<!-- end list -->

  - IPCC *Tier 2* method - If no direct measurements of CF,,4,, and
    C,,2,,F,,6,, have been made at smelters, default industry
    coefficients depending on the cells technologies are used.

If anode effect process data is unavailable or incomplete the Default
sub-category can be used instead, which calculates emissions based on
industry typical values.
