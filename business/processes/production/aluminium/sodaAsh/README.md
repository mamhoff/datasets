This category provides a methodology for calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
from the consumption of soda ash in the aluminium industry. This
methodology is sourced from the WRI Greenhouse Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) but
ultimately derives from the *[Aluminum Sector Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.world-aluminium.org/cache/fl0000127.pdf)* published
by the International Aluminium Institute. The calculation is based on
the carbon content of materials consumed.

To use this category, create a profile item (there are no drill choices)
and specify the required profile items (shown below). The returned value
represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to the process data provided.

## Algorithm

***CO<sub>2</sub> emissions*** = *sodaQuantity \* sodaFrac \* calcFrac \* (44 /
106)*

The factor of 44/106 is the mass ration of CO<sub>2</sub> to Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.
