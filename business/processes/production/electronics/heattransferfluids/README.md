The AMEE category
/business/processes/production/electronics/heattransferfluids contains
data and calculation methodologies for the emissions associated with the
use of heat transfer fluids in the electronics industry.

See the following subcategories for further details:

### Production-based methodology

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/electronics/heattransferfluids/production](Heat_transfer_fluids_production_methodology)
provides a methodology based on the quantity of semiconductor substrate
produced. This methodology represents the *Tier 1* approach described by
the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

### Consumption-based methodology

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/electronics/heattransferfluids/consumption](Heat_transfer_fluids_consumption_methodology)
provides a methodology based on a mass-balance accounting of heat
transfer fluid usage over a specified period. This methodology
represents the *Tier 2* approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
