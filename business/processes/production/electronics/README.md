The AMEE category /business/processes/production/electronics contains
data and methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the electronics industry.

There currently exists two main subcategories which deal with the plasma
etching of silicon containing materials, cleaning of chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) tool chamber-walls and the use of heat transfer fluids
in the semiconductor, LCD and photovoltaic industries.

See the following subcategory for further details.
