The AMEE category business/processes/production/ferroalloy for
calculating greenhouse gas emissions from ferroalloy production. These
methodologies are sourced from the IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)). See
the following subcategories for further details.

### Production-based methodology

The AMEE category
[/business/processes/production/ferroalloy/production](Generic_ferroalloy_production)
contains data and a methodology based on generic emission factors for
each ferroalloy type related to the quantity of ferroalloy produced. The
methodology represents the *Tier 1* (default values) approach described
by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

### Raw materials-based methodology

The AMEE category
[/business/processes/production/ferroalloy/rawmaterials](Ferroalloy_raw_materials_methodology)
contains data and a methodology based raw material inputs to the
ferroalloy production process. The methodology represents the *Tier 2*
and *Tier 3* approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

### Ferroalloy methane emissions

The AMEE category
[/business/processes/production/ferroalloy/ch4](Ferroalloy_methane_emissions)
contains data and a methodology for calculating methane emissions
associated with ferroalloy production. The methodology represents the
*Tier 1* and *Tier 2* approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
