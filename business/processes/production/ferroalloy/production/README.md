The AMEE category business/processes/production/ferroalloy/production is
aimed towards industry professionals to enable them to prepare
inventories of greenhouse gas emissions from ferroalloy production.
Ferroalloy is the term used to describe concentrated alloys of iron and
one or more metals such as silicon, manganese, chromium, molybdenum,
vanadium and tungsten. Silicon metal production is usually included in
the ferroalloy group because silicon metal production process is quite
similar to the ferrosilicon process. Ferroalloy production involves a
metallurgical reduction process that results in significant carbon
dioxide emissions.

The methodology provided by AMEE in this category represents the *Tier
1* (default values) approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
This is the simplest methodology for estimating CO,,2,, emissions from
ferroalloy production, using a generic emission factor for each
ferroalloy type related to the quantity of ferroalloy produced.

## How to use this category

To use this category use the ***typeOfFerroalloy*** drill-down to select
the ferroalloy type being produced from the following options:

1.  *ferrosilicon 45% Si*
2.  *ferrosilicon 65% Si*
3.  *ferrosilicon 75% Si*
4.  *ferrosilicon 90% Si*
5.  *ferromanganeses 7% C*
6.  *ferromanganeses 1% C*
7.  *silicomanganese*
8.  *silicon metal*
9.  *ferrochromium*
10. *ferrochromium with sinter plant*

The only required profile item value is the quantity of ferroalloy
produced, ***productQuantity***. The emission factor for raw material
has a default value provided by the AMEE engine, but this can be
over-ridden, using the ***massCO2PerMassProduct*** profile item value,
by the user if more precise site or country-specific values are known.
