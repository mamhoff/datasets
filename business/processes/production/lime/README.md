This provides data and calculation methodologies to facilitate the
measurement and monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from
lime manufacturing. Major consumption of lime (CaO) stems from steel
making, flue gas desulphurisation at coal-fired electric power plants,
construction, pulp and paper manufacturing and water purification.
Calcination is the process by which limestone, which is mostly calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), is heated in a kiln to produce lime. Carbon
dioxide is a byproduct of this reaction and is usually emitted to the
atmosphere. Some facilities recover a portion of the emissions for use
in sugar refining and precipitated calcium carbonate production.

AMEE offers several methodologies for lime production:

  - **[IPCC Tier 1 production-based
    methodology](Generic_lime_production):** this methodology calculates
    emissions based upon a generic emissions factor for CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions per quantity of lime produced and a default breakdown of
    lime types. The methodology is sourced from the IPCC 2006
    [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
    Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)
    and represents the *Tier 1* approach.

<!-- end list -->

  - **[IPCC Tier 2 production-based
    methodology](Lime_production_data):** this methodology calculates
    emissions using production data and is sourced from the WRI
    Greenhouse Gas protocol
    [worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
    but ultimately follows the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National
    Greenhouse Gas
    Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html).
    Emissions are disaggregated on the bases of the types of lime
    produced and corrected for the production of any hydrated lime and
    any uncalcined lime kiln dust (LKD) that is not recycled to the
    kiln. This category represents the IPCC *Tier 2* approach.

<!-- end list -->

  - **[IAI production-based methodology](IAI_lime_production):** The
    AMEE category business/processes/production/lime/production/iai
    provides a methodology sourced from *[The Aluminium Sector
    Greenhouse Gas
    Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/downloads/calcs/aluminium.pdf)*
    published by the International Aluminium Institute in conjunction
    with the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The methodology is based on
    the quantity and purity of 'quick' (calcium oxide; CaO) and 'slaked'
    (calcium hydroxide; Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) lime produced. The CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions associated with this lime production is based on the known
    ratio in which lime and CO<sub>2</sub> are produced during carbonate
    calcination.

  - **[Inputs-based methodology](Lime_carbonate_composition):** this
    methodology calculates emissions using data on the carbonate
    composition of the raw material feed and is sourced from the WRI
    Greenhouse Gas protocol
    [worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
    but ultimately follows the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National
    Greenhouse Gas
    Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html):.
    Emissions are disaggregated on the basis of the types of carbonates
    used and are corrected for LKD and the fraction of each carbonate
    species that remains uncalcined following lime production. This
    category represents the IPCC *Tier 3* approach.
