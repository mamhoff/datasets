This category contains data and methodology for calculating the
greenhouse gas emissions from lime manufacturing using the carbonate
composition of the raw material that enters the kiln. Emissions are
disaggregated on the basis of the types of carbonates used and are
corrected for LKD and the fraction of each carbonate species that
remains uncalcined following lime production.

This methodology and associated data is sourced from the WRI Greenhouse
Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) but
ultimately follows the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html).
This cateogry represents the IPCC's *Tier 3* approach.
