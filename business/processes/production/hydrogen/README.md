The AMEE category at /business/processes/production/hydrogen/ provides a
methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the
production of hydrogen. See the following subcategories for further
details.

### Emissions from the hydrogen production life cycle

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/hydrogen/production](Life_cycle_hydrogen_production)
provides a methodology based on a default emissions factors for several
stages in the life-cycle of hydrogen production. This methodology is
sourced from the *[Life Cycle Assessment of Hydrogen Production via
Natural Gas Steam
Reforming](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/27637.pdf)* report of the
US Department of Energy's [National Renewable Energy
Laboratory](http://www.nrel.gov/).

### Emissions calculation based on feedstock consumption

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/hydrogen/consumption](Hydrogen_production_by_feedstock)
provides a methodology based on a mass-balance approach taking into
consideration the carbon content of process feedstocks and and carbon or
CO,,2,, recovered for use in other processes. This methodology is
sourced from the guidelines published in conjunction with the EPA's
mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements, and follows approaches
described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)) and
the New Mexico Environment Department Air Quality Bureau *Emissions
Quantification Methods*
