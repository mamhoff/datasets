AMEE contains a number of categories for calculating the greenhouse gas
emissions relating to processes associated with iron and steel
manufacturing. These methodologies are sourced from the WRI Greenhouse
Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools),
the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)
and the US EPA.
