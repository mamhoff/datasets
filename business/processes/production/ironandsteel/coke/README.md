**Metal industry methodology, coke production. Calculates carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions based on the
quantities of materials consumed and produced. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) and **methane**
(CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions associated with the production of **coke**. The data
and calculation methodology is sourced from the [Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) (GHGP) worksheet tool *[CO2 emissions
from the production of iron and steel,
version 2.0](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/files/ghgp/tools/Iron%20and%20Steel.xls)*,
which is ultimately based on the methodologies described in *[Volume 3,
Chapter 4 - Metal Industry
Emissions](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_4_Ch4_Metal_Industry.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Metallurgical coke is the solid product obtained from the carbonisation
of coal (predominantly 'coking coal' ) at high temperature, and is used
as a blast furnace feedstock in the production of iron and steel. As
well as producing coke, this process produces coke oven gas, CO<sub>2</sub>,
CH<sub>4</sub> and other by-products.

This methodology enables the calculation of coke-associated CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions based upon a mass balance approach that accounts for the
carbon inputs and outputs to coke ovens. By considering the carbon
entering the process via the carbon-bearing feedstocks (typically coking
coal, blast furnace gas and other materials), and the carbon leaving the
process within coke, oven gases and other by-products, the discrepancy
can be assumed to have been emitted as CO<sub>2</sub>.

CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are based on an emissions factor which describes the
rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is emitted per unit quantity of coke produced.
This includes iron converted, and not converted, into steel.

This methodology represents the IPCC *Tier 2* approach where default
carbon content data is used for carbon-bearing feedstocks and products,
but *Tier 3* where these are based on facility-specfic data.

### Model data

This methodology is based on a mass-balance of process inputs and
outputs, and depends upon quantities and carbon concentrations for each.
Default carbon content data is provided for a selection of 21
carbon-bearing feedstocks (including blast furnace gas) as well as the
coke and coke oven gas (by-)products for cases where facility-specific
data is not available.

### Activity data required

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions require quantities of feedstocks (including blast
furnace gas specifically) and of coke, coke oven gas and other
(by-)products in order to calculate. In addition, the methodology
enables the specification of facility-specific data carbon content data
where this is available. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions also require the quantity of
coke produced to be specified. A default emissions factor for CH<sub>4</sub> is
available but can be specified if facility- or country-specific data is
available.

### Calculation and results

**CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated by the mass-balance of the
specified input/output activity data. **CH<sub>4</sub>** emissions are
calculated by multiplying the quantity of coke specified by the
appropriate emissions factor. **CO<sub>2</sub>e** emissions are also calculated
by converting absolute emissions using the appropriate [global warming
potentials](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials).

quantities of coke produced is also available.
