**Metal industry methodology, general iron and steel processes.
Calculates carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub>e
emissions based on the quantities of materials produced. Choices include
coke, iron, steel, sinter. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) and **methane**
(CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions associated with the a number of processes employed
in the iron and steel industry. The data and calculation methodology is
sourced from *[Volume 3, Chapter 4 - Metal Industry
Emissions](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_4_Ch4_Metal_Industry.pdf)*
of the *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

This methodology enables the calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>
emissions associated with a selection of production processes associated
with the iron and steel industry (coke, iron, steel, sinter production).
The methodology is based upon emissions factors which describe the
typical rate at which emissions occur in relation to the quantity
produced. Multiplying a quantity produced by the appropriate emissions
factors results in an estimate for the associated emissions.

This methodology represents the IPCC *Tier 1* approach.

### Model data

The rate at which emissions occur varies according to the specfic
process under consideration. This methodology provides CO<sub>2</sub> and
CH<sub>4</sub> emissions factors for 9 distinct processes commonly employed in
the iron and steel industry.

### Activity data required

CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are directly proportionate to the quantity
of material produced, which is therefore required in order to calculate.

### Calculation and results

Emissions are calculated by multiplying the quantity produced by the
appropriate emissions factors. **CO<sub>2</sub>e** emissions are also
calculated by converting absolute emissions using the appropriate
[global warming potentials](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials).
