The AMEE category at business/processes/production/ironandsteel/epa
provides methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production of iron and steel. These methodologies
are sourced from the guidelines published by the [Climate
Leaders](http://www.epa.gov/climateleaders/documents/resources/ironsteel.pdf)
industry-government initiative for reporting and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.

See the following subcategories for further detail.

### Primary production

The AMEE category at
[/business/processes/production/ironandsteel/epa/primary](EPA_primary_iron_and_steel_production)
provides a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production of primary iron and steel. This
methodology accounts for the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to carbonate
calcination and adjusts [stationary
combustion](EPA_stationary_combustion) emissions by accounting for
carbon which remains contained within process products or by-products.

The AMEE category at
[/business/processes/production/ironandsteel/epa/eaf](EPA_EAF_iron_and_steel_production)
provides a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with Electron Arc Furnace (EAF) steel facilities. This
methodology accounts for the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to carbonate flux and
the use of carbon electrodes. Any emissions from coke and/or coal
consumption should be calculated using a methodology for [stationary
combustion](EPA_stationary_combustion).
