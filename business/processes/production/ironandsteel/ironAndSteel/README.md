**Metal industry methodology, iron and steel. Calculates carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions based on the
quantities of materials consumed and produced. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) and **methane**
(CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions associated with the production of **iron and
steel**. The data and calculation methodology is sourced from the
[Greenhouse Gas Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) (GHGP) worksheet tool
*[CO2 emissions from the production of iron and steel,
version 2.0](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/files/ghgp/tools/Iron%20and%20Steel.xls)*,
which is ultimately based on the methodologies described in *[Volume 3,
Chapter 4 - Metal Industry
Emissions](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_4_Ch4_Metal_Industry.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Iron and steel are produced in blast furnaces as iron ores react with a
carbon-bearing feedstock (usually coke) at high temperatures. This
reaction produces molten iron and CO<sub>2</sub>. Some of the carbon within the
original feedstock is incorporated into the iron or steel products or
blast furnace gas by-product.

This methodology enables the calculation of iron and steel-associated
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based upon a mass balance approach that accounts for
the carbon inputs and outputs to blast furnaces. By considering the
carbon entering the process via the carbon-bearing feedstock, and the
carbon leaving the process within products and by-products, the
discrepancy can be assumed to have been emitted as CO<sub>2</sub>.

CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are based on an emissions factor which describes the
rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is emitted per unit quantity of pig iron produced.
This includes iron converted, and not converted, into steel.

This methodology represents the IPCC *Tier 2* approach where default
carbon content data is used for carbon-bearing feedstocks and products,
but *Tier 3* where these are based on facility-specfic data.

### Model data

This methodology is based on a mass-balance of process inputs and
outputs, and depends upon quantities and carbon concentrations for each.
Default carbon content data is provided for a selection of 21
carbon-bearing feedstocks as well as the iron, steel and blast furnace
gas (by-)products for cases where facility-specific data is not
available.

### Activity data required

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions require quantities of feedstock, iron, steel and blast
furnace gas in order to calculate. In addition, the methodology enables
the specification of facility-specific data carbon content data where
this is available. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions require the quantity of pig iron
produced to be specified, and a facility- or country-specific emissions
factor, and are not calculated where these data are unavailable.

### Calculation and results

**CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated by the mass-balance of the
specified input/output activity data. **CH<sub>4</sub>** emissions are
calculated by multiplying the quantity of pig iron specified by the
specified emissions factor. **CO<sub>2</sub>e** emissions are also calculated
by converting absolute emissions using the appropriate [global warming
potentials](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials).

If feedstock and by-product data is unavailable, a [simpler
methodology](Iron_and_steel_generic_processes) based solely on
quantities of iron/steel produced is also available.

IPCC methodologies for other iron and steel-associated process emissions
are also available, including [coke](Iron_and_Steel_coke), [direct
reduced iron](Iron_and_Steel_DRI) and [sinter](Iron_and_Steel_sinter)
production.
