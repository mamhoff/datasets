This category provides data and a methodology for the measurement and
monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the production of
nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>). The methodology is sourced from the WRI
Greenhouse Gas protocol
[worksheets](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) but
ultimately follows the IPCC 2006 [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html).
This category represents *Tiers 1, 2 amd 3* approaches of the IPCC
guidelines.

N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from the production of nitric acid depend on the
quantity of nitric acid produced, plant design, burner conditions and on
the amount of N<sub>2</sub>O destroyed in any subsequent abatement process.

This methodology not cover direct emissions from the combustion of
fossil fuel occurring during the production of nitric acid or indirect
emissions from the purchase of energy used for nitric acid production.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

Use the drill-down ***plantType*** to select the type of plant.

### Specifying activity data

Specify the required profile item values listed below.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent the greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the quantity and parameters specified. The following
quantities are returned:

  - ***N2O***: absolute quantity of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions for the quantity
    specified
  - ***CO2e***: CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions (N<sub>2</sub>O emissions converted using
    the appropriate [global warming
    potential](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials))
