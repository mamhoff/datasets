The AMEE category at business/processes/production/petrochemical/generic
provides data and methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production of several types of petrochemicals. These
methodologies represent the *Tier 1* approaches described by the IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)). The
data is based on integrated ethylene dichloride (EDC)/vinyl chloride
monomer (VCM) plants, rather than stand alone facilities.

See the following subcategories for further details:

  - [Acrylonitrile production](Acrylonitrile_production)
  - [Carbon black production](Carbon_black_production)
  - [Ethylene production](Ethylene_production)
  - [Ethylene dichloride production](Ethylene_dichloride_production)
  - [Ethylene oxide production](Ethylene_oxide_production)
  - [Methanol production](Methanol_production)
  - [Vinyl chloride monomer
    production](Vinyl_chloride_monomer_production)
