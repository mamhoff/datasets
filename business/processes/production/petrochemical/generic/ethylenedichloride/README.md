The AMEE category at
business/processes/production/petrochemical/generic/ethylenedichloride
provides a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production of ethylene dichloride. The methodology
provides two ways to calculate, based on either: (1) the quantity of
ethylene feedstock inputs to the production process; or (2) the quantity
of ethylene dichloride produced. This methodology represents the *Tier
1* approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)). The
data is based on integrated ethylene dichloride (EDC)/vinyl chloride
monomer (VCM) plants, rather than stand alone facilities.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

To use this category, specify the feedstock type and emission type using
the *feedstock* and *emission* drill choices. The *emission* drill
choice represents, variously, emissions associated with combustion,
non-combustive venting or a combination of both of these.

### Specifying activity data

Next, choose between specifying the quantity of ethylene dichloride
produced or the quantity of feedstock consumed. To specify the quantity
of ethylene dichloride produced, set this quantity using the ***mass***
profile item value. Alternatively, specify the quantity of feedstock
using the ***massFeedstock*** profile item value.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent the greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the quantity specified. The following quantities are
returned:

  - ***CO2***: absolute quantity of CO,,2,, emissions for the quantity
    specified
  - ***CH4***: absolute quantity of CH,,4,, emissions for the quantity
    specified
  - ***CO2e***: CO,,2,,e emissions (absolute emissions converted using
    the appropriate [global warming
    potential](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials))
