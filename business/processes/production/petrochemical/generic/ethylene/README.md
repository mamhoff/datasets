The AMEE category at
business/processes/production/petrochemical/generic/ethylene provides a
methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the
steam cracking process. This category covers the production of several
types of hydrocarbon (e.g. ethylene, propylene, butadiene), aggregated
and expressed in terms of ethylene production. The methodology is based
on default emissions factors for CO,,2,, and CH,,4,, emissions per unit
production together with an adjustment factor to account for differences
in the energy efficiency of steam cracking units across different
geographic locations. This methodology represents the *Tier 1* approach
described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

To use this category, specify the feedstock type, the process type and
the geographic region using the *feedstock*, *process* and *region*
drill choices. The *process* drill choice represents, variously,
emissions associated with feedstock consumption, supplemental energy
consumption or a combination of both of these.

### Specifying activity data

Next, specify the quantity of ethylene produced using the ***mass***
profile item value.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent the greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the specified quantity of steam cracking production
(represented by ethylene production). The following quantities are
returned:

  - ***CO2***: absolute quantity of CO,,2,, emissions for the quantity
    specified
  - ***CH4***: absolute quantity of CH,,4,, emissions for the quantity
    specified
  - ***CO2e***: CO,,2,,e emissions (absolute emissions converted using
    the appropriate [global warming
    potential](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials))
