The AMEE category at business/processes/production/petrochemical
provides several methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production of petrochemicals. The methodologies are
based on the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

## Generic calculations

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/petrochemical/generic](Generic_petrochemical_production)
provides a methodologies based on default emissions factors relating to
the quantity of petrochemical produced or feedstock consumed. These
methodologies represent the *Tier 1* approach described by the IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

## Carbon mass-balance calculations

The AMEE category at
[business/processes/production/petrochemical/massbalance](Petrochemical_mass_balance_methodology)
provides a methodology based on a mass-balance approach which accounts
for all of the carbon contained within process feedstocks, products and
by-products. This methodology represents the *Tier 2* approach described
by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

**Note**: The IPCC also provides a *Tier 3* method which considers the
emissions arising from three process components: (1) fuel or by-product
combustion; (2) process venting of CO,,2,, and CH,,4,,; (3) flaring of
waste gases. Users of AMEE are referred to the following AMEE categories
for calculating emissions due to combustion and flaring:

  - [business/energy/stationaryCombustion](Stationary_Combustion)
  - [/business/processes/fugitive/methaneflaring](Methane_flaring)
