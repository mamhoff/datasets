The AMEE category at
/business/processes/production/petrochemical/massbalance/carboncontent
contains data on the carbon contents of feedstocks, products and
by-products relating to the petrochemical industry. The category used by
the AMEE category
/business/processes/production/petrochemical/massbalance as reference
for default carbon content values. The data is sourced from volumes 2
and 3 of the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl)).

The petrochemical materials are sourced from Volume 3,
[Chapter 3](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_3_Ch3_Chemical_Industry.pdf)
which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions associated with the chemical
industry.

Several of the fuel types are taken from Volume 2,
[Chapter 1](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_1_Ch1_Introduction.pdf)
which focuses on energy production and consumption and provides data for
a comprehensive list of fuels. The *mass*-based carbon contents found in
this category, were derived from the documented *energy-based carbon
content* (kg per GJ) and *energy per mass* (i.e. 'net calorific value';
TJ per Gg) data.

This category cannot be used to create profile items.
