The AMEE category at /business/processes/carbonates provides data and
methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with
typical industrial carbonate consumption. See the following
subcategories for further details.

### Generic carbonate consumption

The AMEE category at
[/business/processes/carbonates/generic](Generic_carbonate_consumption)
provides a methodology based upon assumptions relating to the typical
national mix of carbonate minerals which are consumed in industry (85%
limestone, 15% dolomite) as well as the purity of these minerals. This
methodology represents the *Tier 1 and 2* approaches described by the
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).

### Specific carbonate consumption

The AMEE category
[/business/processes/carbonates/specific](Specific_carbonate_consumption)
provides a methodology based on specific quantities of various carbonate
species, and represents the *Tier 3* approach described by the IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
([NGGIP](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html)).
