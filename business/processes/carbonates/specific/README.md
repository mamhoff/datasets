**Mineral industry methodology, general carbonate calcination.
Calculates carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions based on the quantities
and calcination fractions of calcite, magnesite, dolomite, siderite,
ankerite, rhodochrosite and soda ash. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions
associated with the **calcination of carbonate minerals**. The data and
calculation methodology is sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as published
in *[Volume 3, Chapter 2 - Mineral Industry
Emissions](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_2_Ch2_Mineral_Industry.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.
This methodology represents the IPCC ***tier 3*** approach.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and dolomite (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) are basic raw
materials having commercial applications in a number of industries. The
heating of carbonate minerals to high temperatures ('calcining')
produces metallic oxides as well as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This methodology
calculates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the general consumption (through
calcination) of carbonate minerals.

The methodology represents a *mass-balance* approach which considers the
quantities of carbon (C) which enter the calcination process from *all*
carbonate inputs and attributes any C which is unaccounted for on
completion of the calcination process to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The total
quantity of each carbonate input fully calcined (and therefore emitted
as CO<sub>2</sub>) is determined on the basis of the **input quantity** (i.e.
mass) and the **fraction calcination achieved** (i.e. a decimal
fraction, 0-1). This calcined quantity in then converted into it's
corresponding CO<sub>2</sub> quantity on the basis of conversion factors which
represent the *stoichiometry* of the chemical processes, i.e. the known
molecular mass ratio of the reactant carbonate material and the product
CO<sub>2</sub>.

Carbonate inputs of **calcite** (or it's polymorph, **aragonite**),
**magnesite**, **dolomite**, **siderite**, **ankerite**,
**rhodochrosite**, and **soda ash** can be itemised as part of any
calculation.

### Model data

CO<sub>2</sub> conversion factors (**stoichiometric ratios**) for all carbonate
types are sourced from the IPCC and can be found
[here](Stoichiometries_ratios).

### Activity data required

Greenhouse gas emissions are directly proportionate to the **quantity**
(i.e. mass) of carbonates consumed. In addition, the **fraction
calcination achieved** for each individual carbonate input can be
specified (100% calcination is assumed otherwise).

### Calculation and results

**CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions are calculated by multiplying each carbonate input
by it's respective calcination fraction and CO<sub>2</sub> conversion factor
(stoichiometric ratio).

This emissions calculated by this methodology represent those
attributable to all specified quantities of carbonate calcined.

carbonate calcination. These include the IPCC *[tier 1 and
tier 2](Generic_carbonate_consumption)* methodologies which correspond
to this methodology, as well as methodologies specific to [soda ash
consumption](Aluminium_soda_ash), as well as
