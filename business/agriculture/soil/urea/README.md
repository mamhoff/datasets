**Managed soils methodology, urea application. Calculates carbon dioxide
emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>) based on quantities of urea applied. Globally
applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **carbon dioxide** (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions
associated with the **application of urea to managed soils**. The data
and calculation methodology is sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as
published in *[Volume 4, Chapter 11 - N2O Emissions from Managed Soils,
and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea
Application](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_11_Ch11_N2O&CO2.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Adding urea to soils during fertilisation leads to a loss of CO<sub>2</sub>
that was fixed in the industrial production process. Urea
(CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is converted into ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>^^+^^), hydroxyl
ion (OH^^-^^), and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>^^-^^), in the presence of water
and urease enzymes. The bicarbonate which is formed evolves into CO<sub>2</sub>
and water (H<sub>2</sub>O).

The methodology calculates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on the *mass-balance*
of carbon (C) applied during treatment. This assumes that all C added to
soils is eventually emitted as CO<sub>2</sub>.

This methodology represents the IPCC *Tier 1* approach.

### Model data

The precise relationship between the quantity of urea applied and the
quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted depends on the concentration of carbon
within urea. A carbon content (by weight) factor is provided for urea
which allows the conversion of a quantity of urea into a quantity of C.

In addition, this methodology uses a second conversion factor,
representing the ratio of the molecular mass of CO<sub>2</sub> and the atomic
mass of C. This quantity allows the conversion of a quantity of C into
the corresponding quantity of CO<sub>2</sub>. In combination, these two
conversion factors enable the conversion of a quantity of urea into a
quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted - under the assumption of mass-balance.

### Activity data required

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are directly proportionate to the **quantity of urea
applied**, which therefore needs to be specified in order to make an
emissions calculation.

### Calculation and results

This emissions calculated by this methodology represent those
attributable to the specified quantity of urea applied to managed soils.

## Additional information

### Inventory compilation

The application of urea to soils releases CO<sub>2</sub> which was fixed (taken
out of the atmosphere) during the manufacture of urea. If emissions
reductions are included within an inventory on the basis of this
manufacturing process, these are offset if urea is used on managed soils
within the same jurisdiction.

These include those arising from the addition of [urine and
dung](Animal_associated_soil_N2O_emissions),
[lime/carbonates](Soil_liming) and [synthetic and organic
fertilizers](Fertilizer_associated_soil_N2O_emissions), as well as
[organically-managed](N2O_emissions_from_managed_organic_soils) soils.
