The AMEE category /business/agriculture/soil contains data and
methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions from managed
soils, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_11_Ch11_N2O&CO2.pdf).

Several subcategories are available.

## N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from managed organic soils

The category
[/business/agriculture/soil/organic](N2O_emissions_from_managed_organic_soils)
contains a methodology for calculating the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions associated
with the management of organic soils.

## N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soil applications

The category
[/business/agriculture/soil/inputs](N2O_emissions_from_soil_applications)
contains methodologies for calculating the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions associated
with the addition of synthetic and organic (i.e. manure, compost, etc.)
fertilizers into managed soils.

## Soil liming

The category [/business/agriculture/soil/lime](Soil_liming) contains a
methodology for calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the
addition of lime onto managed soils.

## Soil urea application
