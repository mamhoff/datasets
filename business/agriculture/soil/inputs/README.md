The AMEE category /business/agriculture/soil/inputs contains a
methodology for calculating the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions associated with the
application of nitrogen to managed soils, sourced from the IPCC
[Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_11_Ch11_N2O&CO2.pdf).

Two subcategories are available and contain data for animal-associated
nitrogen inputs (i.e. urine and dung) and inputs from other organic and
synthetic fertilizers. Both methodologies incorporate direct and
indirect (leaching, volatilisation) emissions associated with each
source. See the appropriate subcategories for further details.
