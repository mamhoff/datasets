  isLeached: This value can be set to 'true' to specify that the soil expriences leaching. Otherwise leaching is assumed to be absent
  fractionLeached: Typical fraction of fertilizer-N which is leached
  fractionVolatilised: Typical fraction of fertilizer-N which is volatilised
  isRice: This value can be set to 'true' to specify a rice cultivation context. Otherwise a non-rice system is assumed
  massPerMassLeached: Conversion factor for leached-N to N<sub>2</sub>O-N
  subtype: Subtype of soil application
  type: Type of soil application
  massPerMass: Direct conversion factor for applied-N to N<sub>2</sub>O-N
