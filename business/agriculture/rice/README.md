**Cropland methodology, rice cultivation. Calculates methane emissions

quantity of organic soil amendments. Scenarios include irrigated, rain
fed and upland contexts with a variety of flooding regimes. Globally
applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **methane** (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions associated
with the *the cultivation of rice*. The data and calculation methodology
is sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as published in *[Volume 4, Chapter 10
-
Cropland](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_05_Ch5_Cropland.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

The decomposition of organic material under *anaerobic* conditions (i.e.
in the absence of oxygen) in flooded rice fields produces CH<sub>4</sub>. The
*intensity* of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions (i.e. emissions per unit of land area
cultivated) is related to the quantity of crops grown and the duration
of the cultivation period, as well as irrigation and drainage regimes
and the application of organic soil amendments.

This emissions methodology is based upon a baseline emissions factor
which describes the typical **daily** rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is produced
per unit of land area. This baseline factor represents cases where
fields are continuously flooded during the cultivation period, not
flooded at all during the 180 days prior to cultivation, and receive no
organic amendments. Differences between the baseline scenario and other
scenarios are accounted for by the use of *scaling factors* which
'correct' the baseline emissions factor for the effects of particular
water regimes (occuring both before and during the cultivation period)
and/or any organic amendments made to the soil.

Emissions for a particular cultivation period are calculated by
multiplying the (modified) *per area·time* emissions rates by the total
area and duration of the cultivation period under consideration.

This methodology represents the IPCC *Tier 1* approach.

### Model data

The rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is emitted during rice cultivation depends on
water flooding/drainage regimes (before and during cultivation) and
rates and types of organic amendments to the soil. As such, emissions
factor scaling factors for a broad range of scenarios are provided
within this methodology. A total of 198 specific scenarios are
represented, differentiated by **hydrological context** (e.g.,
*irrigated*, *rainfed*, *upland*), **cultivation period flooding
regime** (e.g., *continuous*, *multiple aeration*), **time since last
flooding** (prior to cultivation; e.g. *over 180 days*, *under 30 days*)
and **type of organic amendment** (e.g. *compost*, *farm yard manure*).

Each scenario is represented by the baseline CH<sub>4</sub> emissions rate (kg
/ ha·day) as well as specific scaling factors for prior- and
during-cultivation water regimes and particular types of organic
amendments. In addition, the methodology uses the *global warming
potential* of CH<sub>4</sub> to convert absolute emissions quantities into
**[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials)** - the
quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> which would exert the same atmospheric warming
effect.

### Activity data required

CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are directly proportionate to the **cultivated area**
and **cultivation period**, both of which must be specified in order to
make a calculation. In addition, the **rate of organic soil amendments**
(i.e. mass / area) can be specified if appropriate.

### Calculation and results

This emissions calculated by this methodology represent those
attributable to the specified area of land cultivated for the duration
of the specified cultivation period.

The methodology calculates two emissions quantities: (1) the
**absolute** quantity of methane associated with the livestock
population; and (2) methane emissions expressed in terms of
**[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials)**.
