The AMEE category business/agriculture/livestock/manure/N2O contains
data on direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions associated with the
storage and treatment of livestock manure, sourced from the IPCC
[National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Programme](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_10_Ch10_Livestock.pdf).

The category represents the *Tier 1* data and calculation methods
recommended in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories (Volume 4, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use).

Direct N<sub>2</sub>O emissions are based on data describing typical nitrogen
(N) excretion rates (per livestock mass/head) associated with specific
livestock types as well as N =\> N<sub>2</sub>O emissions factors associated
with each particular method of manure management.

Indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (which arise from the loss of the volatile N
component from the manure) are based on data describing the proportion
of manure N loss through volatilisation for each livestock and manure
management type, as well as an emission factor for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions
from atmospheric nitrogen sources. Data on the fraction of manure N lost
through volatilization is not provided for all combinations of livestock
type and manure management method in the primary source documentation.
Where possible, AMEE returns the sum of both direct and indirect N<sub>2</sub>O
emissions. Otherwise, the returned values represent direct emissions
only.
