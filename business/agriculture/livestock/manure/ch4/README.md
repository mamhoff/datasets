The AMEE category business/agriculture/livestock/manure/CH4 contains
data on the methane emissions associated with the storage and treatment
of livestock manure, sourced from the IPCC [National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories
Programme](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_10_Ch10_Livestock.pdf)..

The category represents the *Tier 1* data and calculation methods
recommended in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories (Volume 4, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use). These
data are based on typical volatile solid excretion rates and maximum
methane production capacities for each specific livestock type as well
as manure =\> methane conversion factors weighted according to the
manure management type mix specific to each region/context.

The data is organised into three subcategories:

  - [Cattle and swine](Cattle_and_swine_manure_methane_emissions) -
    includes emissions methodologies for several types of cattle and
    swine

<!-- end list -->

  - [Poultry](Poultry_manure_methane_emissions) - includes emissions
    methodologies for several types of poultry

<!-- end list -->

  - [Other livestock](Other_manure_methane_emissions) - includes
    emissions methodologies for camel, deer, fur-bearing animals (e.g.
    fox, mink), goat, horse, mules/asses, ostrich, rabbits, reindeer and
    sheep
