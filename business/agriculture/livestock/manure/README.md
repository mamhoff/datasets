The AMEE category business/agriculture/livestock/manure contains data on
the emissions associated with the storage and treatment of livestock
manure, sourced from the IPCC [National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Programme](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_10_Ch10_Livestock.pdf).
These categories represent *Tier 1* approaches.

The data is organised into the following subcategories which relate to
CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions respectively:

  - [Manure\_associated\_methane\_emissions](Manure_associated_methane_emissions)

<!-- end list -->

  - [Manure\_associated\_nitrous\_oxide\_emissions](Manure_associated_nitrous_oxide_emissions)
