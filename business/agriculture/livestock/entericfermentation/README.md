**Domestic livestock methodology, enteric fermentation. Calculates
methane emissions (CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>e) based on livestock population.
Scenarios include cattle, deer, goats, sheep, swine and others. Globally
applicable.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **methane** (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions associated
with the **digestive processes of herbivorous livestock**. The data and
calculation methodology is sourced from the [IPCC](IPCC), as published
in *[Volume 4, Chapter 10 - Emissions from Livestock and Manure
Management](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_10_Ch10_Livestock.pdf)*
of their *[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)*.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

Methane is produced in herbivores as a by-product of *enteric
fermentation*, a digestive process by which carbohydrates are broken
down by micro-organisms into simple molecules for absorption into the
bloodstream. This emissions methodology is based upon emissions factors
which describe the rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is produced by *single 'heads'
of livestock* (i.e. individual animals) and are expressed on an
**annual** basis.

Annual emission rates for a population or sub-population of livestock
(e.g. *kg / year*) are calculated by multiplying the *per animal*
emissions rates by the total number of livestock under consideration.

This methodology represents the IPCC *Tier 1* approach.

### Model data

The rate at which CH<sub>4</sub> is produced during enteric fermentation is
related to the type of livestock (more specifically, the type of
digestive tract), and age as well as the quality and quantity of the
livestock's feed intake. Ruminant livestock (e.g., buffalo, cattle,
deer, goats, sheep) are major sources of methane with moderate amounts
produced from non-ruminant livestock (e.g., pigs, horses). Feed intake
varies with animal size, growth rate and 'productivity' (e.g. milk or
wool production, or pregnancy), while feed quality, animal size and
population structure vary geographically.

A total of 67 specific livestock scenarios are represented and are
differentiated by **livestock type** (i.e. *diary cattle*, *deer*,
*sheep*, *swine*), **subtype** (cattle only; e.g. *mature males*,
*calves on milk*) and the **geographic region**. Cattle are
differentiated by continent, whereas other types of livestock are
differentiated between those kept in developed *versus* developing
countries.

Each livestock type is represented by an annual methane emissions rate
per individual animal (kg / yr). In addition, the methodology uses the
*global warming potential* of CH<sub>4</sub> to convert absolute emissions
quantities into
**[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials)** - the
quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> which would exert the same atmospheric warming
effect.

### Activity data required

According to this methodology, methane emissions are directly
proportionate to the **total population of livestock** kept, which
therefore must be specified in order to make an emissions calculation.

### Calculation and results

This emissions calculated by this methodology represent those
attributable to the specified population of livestock over a period of 1
year.

The methodology calculates two emissions quantities: (1) the
**absolute** quantity of methane associated with the livestock
population; and (2) methane emissions expressed in terms of
**[CO<sub>2</sub>e](Greenhouse_gases_Global_warming_potentials)** - the
quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> which would exert the same atmospheric warming
effect.

## Additional information

### Wild animals

Following [IPCC](IPCC) advice, the emissions of wild ruminants (e.g.
buffalo, cattle, deer, goats, sheep) should not be considered when
compiling emissions inventories. Rather, emissions should only be
considered from animals under domestic management.
