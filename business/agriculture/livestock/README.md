The AMEE category /business/agriculture/livestock contains data and
methodologies for calculating greenshouse gas emissions associated with
the keeping of livestock, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_05_Ch5_Cropland.pdf).

Two main subcategories of emissions are currently available:

## Enteric fermentation

The AMEE category
[/business/agriculture/livestock/entericfermentation](Enteric_fermentation)
provides data and emissions calculations relating to digestive
fermentation for various types of livestock.

## Manure management

The AMEE category
[/business/agriculture/livestock/manure](Manure_management) provides
data and emissions calculations relating to the management and treatment
of manure for various types of livestock and management systems.
