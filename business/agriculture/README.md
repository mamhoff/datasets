The AMEE category business/agriculture contains data on CO<sub>2</sub> and
other greenhouse gas emissions associated with a variety of agricultural
practices, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_05_Ch5_Cropland.pdf).

This category currently contains subcategories providing data and
calculations for emissions associated with the agricultural sector.

## Livestock

The AMEE category [/business/agriculture/livestock](Livestock) provides
data and methodologies for calculating CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions
associated with livestock enteric fermentation (digestive gases) and
manure.

## Rice cultivation

The AMEE category [/business/agriculture/rice](Rice_cultivation)
provides data and methodologies for calculating CH<sub>4</sub> emissions
associated with rice cultivation in a spectrum of environmental and
management contexts.

## Soil management

The AMEE category [/business/agriculture/soil](Soil_management) provides
data and methodologies for calculating greenhouse emissions associated
with the management of soils, e.g. fertilizer application.
