[Climate Leaders](http://www.epa.gov/climateleaders/) is a joint
[EPA](http://www.epa.gov/)-industry programme for reducing corporate
impact on the environment. Climate Leaders helps companies to calculate
corporate-wide greenhouse gas emissions inventories, set reduction
targets, and establish a transparent and credible record of their
impacts and accomplishments through annual reporting to the EPA.

Associated with the Climate Leaders initiative are a number of
[technical
guidance](http://www.epa.gov/climateleaders/resources/index.html)
documents which outline calculation methodologies and provide data for
calculating greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of sources. These
cover stationary and mobile fuel combustion, electricity, refrigeration
and air conditioning, as well as several industry specific methodologies
such as those for the iron and steel industry. For some important
industrial cases where specific methodologies are not provided, Climate
Leaders recommends methodologies published by the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol and their partners in industry (e.g. aluminium, cement, paper).
