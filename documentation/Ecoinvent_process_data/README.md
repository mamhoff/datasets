Processes within the *ecoinvent database* are multi-dimensional - this
includes time, geographic area, technical, and system boundary aspects
of LCA.

## Process level data

The processes represent in most cases the average of currently used
technology. In some cases alternatives such as the best, or even near
future best available technologies on the market are modelled. Whilst
this information applies mainly to the market (and thus consumption)
situation in Europe (RER) and Switzerland (CH) originally for the year
2000, for the case of the extraction of mineral and energy resources,
ecoinvent data describes certain production processes which take place
outside Europe. However this meant that for regions that process data
availability is rather poor and actual country-specific data could not
be used equivalent assumptions and approximations were substituted.
Emissions from the past, the present and the future are all included in
the ecoinvent database. When these emissions refer to long lasting
processes they are provided in a separate, suitably named, subcategory
e.g. “long-term”.

A full description of the process data can be found within [Overview and
Methodology Data v2.0
