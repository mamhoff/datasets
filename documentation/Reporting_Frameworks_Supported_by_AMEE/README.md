Reporting frameworks provide guidance to enable businesses to report
greenhouse gas emissions in a standardised and comparable way - see the
[Standards](Standards) page for more detail.

  - **[Global Reporting Initiative](Global_Reporting_Initiative)
    (GRI)**. The Global Reporting Initiative aims to create conditions
    for the transparent and reliable exchange of sustainability
    information. This is achieved through the development and continuous
    improvement of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Framework. This
    framework allows companies to be compared like for like. The GRI
    refers to the greenhouse gas protocol and IPCC for data sets and
    methodologies for its reporting.

  - **[Greenhouse\_Gas\_Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)'s Corporate
    Standard (GHGP)**. Corporate Standard provides standards and
    guidance for companies and other organizations preparing a GHG
    emissions inventory. The reporting guidelines cover the six
    greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol - carbon dioxide
    (CO,,2,,), methane (CH,,4,,), nitrous oxide (N,,2,,O),
    hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur
    hexafluoride (SF,,6,,). The majority of information is aimed at US
    and UK interests, but there is also a significant amount of
    international information.

  - **[ISO 14064](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38381)**.
    Specifies principles and requirements at an organization level for
    the quantification and reporting of GHG emissions and removals
    (including requirements for the design, development, management,
    reporting and verification of GHG inventories). There are three
    parts: Part 1 refers to the GHG protocol and AMEEdiscover can help
    address the auditability aspects of Parts 2 and 3.

  - **[The Kyoto
    Protocol](http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php)**. The
    Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United
    Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major feature of
    the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37
    industrialized countries and the European community for reducing
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These amount to an average of five
    per cent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008-2012.
    AMEE contains information on all gases that the Kyoto Protocol
    requires countries to monitor.
