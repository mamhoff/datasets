## What's New?

  - **3 December 2010** - AMEE has upgraded its coverage of [grid
    electricity](US_Subregion_Electricity) in the United States by
    adding data representing the subregions of the North American
    Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).
  - **29 November 2010** - *Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)* data from the
    *ecoinvent Centre* is now available in its entirety via AMEEdiscover
    and the AMEE API. For more details, check out the dedicated
    [Ecoinvent](Ecoinvent_database) AMEEdiscover page.
  - **24 November 2010** - AMEE now supports multiple calculation
    outputs. A large number of AMEE methodologies therefore now return
    emissions quantities differentiated into specific greenhouse gases
    (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>e) as well as other useful
    information. See
    [this](Passenger_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) example for
    an idea of this new funtionality.
