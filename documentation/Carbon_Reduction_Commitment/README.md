The Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme (formally
known as the Carbon Reduction Commitment) is the UK's mandatory climate
change and energy saving scheme. The scheme started in April 2010 and is
administered by the Environment Agency. It is central to the UK's
strategy for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide
emissions, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. It has been
designed to raise awareness in large organizations, especially at senior
level, and encourage changes in behaviour and infrastructure. This is
vital to achieving th UK's overall targets of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050 by at least 80 percent compared to the 1990 baseline.

Under this scheme, organisations which use at least one Half Hourly
electricity meter and greater than 6,000 MWh of electricity per year are
required to report on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with their total
energy consumption (electricity + other energy sources) except that
associated with transport or onward supply.

CRC will affect large organisations in both the public and private
sector. Organizations that meet the qualification criteria (based
electricity consumption in 2008), will be obliged to participate in CRC.
Participating organizations will have to monitor their emissions and
purchase allowances, initially sold by Government, for each tonne of
CO<sub>2</sub> they emit. This provides a direct incentive for organizations to
reduce their emissions.

In June 2011, the UK government published tentative proposals for
[simplifying the
CRC](http://www.decc.gov.uk/media/viewfile.ashx?filetype=4&filepath=11/cutting-emissions/crc-efficiency/2088-simplifying-crc-next-steps.pdf&minwidth=true).
These proposals are due for public consultation in 2012 with a view to
full implementation in 2013.

The AMEEdiscover pages listed in the "Pages in this Standard" tab
provide data and emissions calculations based on the data and
calculating methodology specified in the
