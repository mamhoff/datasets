The [Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI)](http://www.globalreporting.org/Home) is a widely used
sustainability reporting framework which sets out the principles and
indicators that organizations can use to measure and report their
economic, environmental, and social performance. AMEE provides an
excellent level of support for GRI compliance.

Emissions related reporting requirements are documented in the
['Environment'](http://www.globalreporting.org/NR/rdonlyres/D2BC0DF8-FF2C-4BAB-B2B4-27DA868C2A5F/2800/smallG3_IP_EN_ENG_andcov.pdf)
category of the Indicator Protocols Set. GRI recommends that reporters
use the methodologies of the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHGP)](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/) and/or the [Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change
(IPCC)](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html) to
calculate greenhouse gas emissions. AMEE supports the IPCC-NGGIP and the
GHGP recommended datasets (which, in many cases, ultimately derives from
the IPCC), with new data being added on a continual basis.

To discover data and calculation methodologies which can provide support
for the GRI see the following pages:
