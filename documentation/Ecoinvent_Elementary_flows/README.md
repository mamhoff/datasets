Data within the *ecoinvent database* are grouped into entities called
Elementary flows. These are the flows of pollutants and resources
between the technosphere and nature. More specifically they describe (a)
the material or energy entering the system being studied, which has been
drawn from the environment without previous human transformation and (b)
material or energy leaving the system being studied, which is discarded
into the environment without subsequent human transformation

Within the ecoinvent database they are identified by a human readable
flow name (e.g. “Carbon dioxide, fossil”), a category and a subcategory.

Categories describe the different environmental compartments like soil
and water and subcategories further distinguish relevant subcompartments
within these compartments. They are grouped as follows:

### Elementary flow factors

The *ecoinvent database* offers life cycle inventory (LCI) and life
cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results. LCIA methods normally assign a
factor known as an *Impact factor* to each elementary flow in an
inventory table. The *ecoinvent Centre* refer to these as *elementary
flow factors*. There are different types of factors, which are described
below.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Characterisation factor</td>
<td>The importance of single flows relative to a specific basic flow is characterised by a factor, e.g. global warming potential of greenhouse gases relative to CO<sub>2</sub>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Normalized factor</td>
<td>Another factor, e.g. a characterisation factor, is normalized by division through the total sum of the characterised flows in a certain area and within a certain time.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Weighted (…) factor</td>
<td>A weighting is applied to the characterised or normalised results from different categories in order to calculate a final score.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Damage factor</td>
<td>The possible damage due to an emission is described with a factor. This can include a modelling for the environmental fate, a characterisation of the substances and a final weighting.</td>
</tr>
