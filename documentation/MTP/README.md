MTP stands for [Market Transformation
Programme](http://efficient-products.defra.gov.uk/) and offers a vast
amount of information on household appliances and other products for
sale in the UK market.

MTP data was previously available on the web using the associated
*What-If? Tool*. This is no longer available, but the raw data from
which several AMEE datasets are derived can be found using the [MTP
document
library](http://efficient-products.defra.gov.uk/cms/product-strategies/sector#viewlist).
