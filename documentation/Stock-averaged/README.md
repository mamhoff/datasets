The stock-averaged value accounts for the fact that appliances in
current use are models that have been produced and purchased in previous
years. Over these years the energy consumed by an appliance will have
varied due to advances in technology.

Some appliances become more energy-efficient as technology advances, but
other appliances - notably computers - now consume more energy than
before.

The following example illustrates a stock average for desktop computers
(without monitors) between the years 2004 and 2006.

So, the typical desktop computer in use in 2007 will consume 226 kWh of
energy in one year.
