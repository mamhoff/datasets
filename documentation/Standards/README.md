The **[datasets and
methodologies](Primary_Data_and_Methodologies_Represented_in_AMEE)**
page offers a brief description of a number of AMEE's most important
sources together with links into pages which give further details on
them.

The **[reporting frameworks](Reporting_Frameworks_Supported_by_AMEE)**
page lists standards which offer guidelines on how to report emissions.
Compliance with these standards makes requirements of client-side
applications that are built on top of AMEE rather than of the AMEE
platform itself. Advice is given on how the AMEE platform and
AMEEdiscover can be used to ease the process of complying with reporting
frameworks.

## Standards: Data Set, Methodology or Reporting Framework?

The term "standard" is used very broadly and often means different
things to different people. To clarify this point we adhere to following
definitions:

  - **Data sets**: Information (numeric or text) relating to specific
    activities. In AMEE these are most commonly "emission factors", but
    may also include other values, such as stoichiometries, global
    warming potentials, energy consumptions, efficiencies or any
    specific information relating to a particular category. Examples of
    data sets include Defra GHG CF and the Ecoinvent database.

  - **Methodologies**: This is a complete description of how to make an
    emissions calculation, which can be represented as equations or
    implemented as computer code. A complete methodology will also
    define all the terms involved and state what assumptions are
    involved. Most methodologies specify a particular data set, but in
    many cases this is a recommendation rather than a requirement. For
    example, the GHGP worksheets specify a methodology via formulas in
    cells, but the user can replace the emission factors with more
    accurate values if available. Examples of methodologies include the
    GHG Protocol's worksheets and the IPCC NGGIP.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Reporting Frameworks**: In some cases the words "standard" and
    "protocol" refer to the how emissions are reported rather than the
    details of the data or methodology used. To avoid confusion AMEE
    uses the term "reporting framework" for this purpose. A reporting
    framework contains guidelines for presenting the results of applying
    methodologies so that they can be shared with other parties in a
    recognisable format. This will usually involve aggregating the
    results to reflect organisational structures. The main use of
    adhering to a particular framework is that the results can be
    compared or benchmarked with other similar organisations and through
    time. Examples of reporting frameworks include the Greenhouse Gas
    Protocol's Corporate Standard, the Global Reporting Initiative and
    the Kyoto Protocol.

The word "standard" is often used in the context of GHG reporting to
mean any combination of the above. In AMEE we use the word "standard" as
a generic term that could mean any one of the above. So, for example,
this statement "the standards that apply internationally" means "the
data sets, methodologies and reporting frameworks that apply
internationally" and if we mean only methodologies, we would say "the
methodologies that apply internationally".
