The
[EMEP/EEA](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-emission-inventory-guidebook-2009)
air pollutant emission inventory guidebook (formerly referred to as the
EMEP CORINAIR emission inventory guidebook) provides guidance on
estimating emissions from both anthropogenic and natural emission
sources. It is designed to facilitate reporting of emission inventories
by countries to the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air
Pollution and the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive. The EEA
publishes the Guidebook, with the UNECEâ€™s Task Force on Emission
Inventories and Projections having responsibility for the technical
content of the chapters.

## The EMEP/EEA aviation methodology

The
[guidebook](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-emission-inventory-guidebook-2009)
provides detailed fuel consumption data for over 140 specific jet,
turboprop and military aircraft types, and represents the foremost
methodology for calculation aviation-associated greenhouse gas
emissions.

Aircraft fuel consumption dynamics are differentiated by into associated
with landing and take off (LTO) phases (taxiing, take off, climb out,
landing) and cruising at altitude. This fuel consumption is converted
into CO,,2,, emissions by using a CO,,2,, emissions factor of 3.15 (kg
CO,,2,, per kg fuel). This value corresponds to the CO,,2,, emissions
factor for 'jet fuel' specified by the IPCC (1999).
