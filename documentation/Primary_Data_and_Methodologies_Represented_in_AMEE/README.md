A methodology details how emissions should be calculated, recommending
or requiring use of a particular data set - see the
[Standards](Standards) page for a full definition. Below is a list of
the best known methodologies that are supported in the AMEE.

  - **[Greenhouse Gas Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) (GHGP)
    worksheets**. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is one of the most widely
    used international greenhouse gas accounting tools. The scope of the
    methodology concentrates on the US and UK, but also includes a
    significant amount of international information. The GHGP tools are
    split into two sections - general tools and sector specific tools
    covering areas such as industrial processes (e.g. aluminium
    manufacture), transport (including freighting), general fuel
    factors, waste and water treatment. This methodology is built with
    industry, large international businesses and governments in mind.

  - **[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change NGGIP](IPCC) (IPCC
    NGGIP)**. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is one of
    the leading bodies for the assessment of climate change, set up by
    United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World
    Meteorological Organization (WMO). One of the projects of the IPCC
    is the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Protocol (IPCC-NGGIP),
    written in collaboration with the Organisation for Economic
    Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Energy
    Agency (IEA). This is the source of the AMEE IPCC data. The
    international scope of the IPCC data in AMEE covers a wide range of
    sectors, including agriculture, transport, fugitive, industry and
    waste.

  - **[DEFRA/DECC GHG Conversion Factors (DEFRA GHG CF)](DEFRA_DECC)**.
    The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) separated from
    The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in
    2008. DECC was created as a separate department to bring together
    energy policy and climate change mitigation policy. They publish
    yearly reports containing advice on greenhouse gas reporting, a
    large emissions data set and calculations recommendations. The scope
    of the data set is UK based data sets on a wide range of subjects
    including waste, home appliances, personal transport, international
    electricity, refrigeration and some supply chain information. This
    data is aimed more towards the individual or small UK-based
    business.

  - **[Carbon Reduction Commitment](Carbon_Reduction_Commitment)
    (CRC)**. The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme is the UK's mandatory
    climate change and energy saving scheme. This contains
    government-mandated CO<sub>2</sub> emission factors for 24 fuels plus
    standard factors for pipeline/grid gas and electricity.

<!-- end list -->

  - **[Environmental Protection Agency - Mandatory GHG
    Ruling](EPA_GHG_Mandatory_Ruling) (EPA)**. The US Environmental
    Protection Agency is a US government agency assigned with protecting
    the natural environment and safeguarding human health. The EPA
    publishes data in a wide variety of greenhouse gas related contexts
    including emissions factors and calculation methodologies. In
    particular, the EPA has published detailed [technical
    guidance](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/archived/ghg_tsd.html)
    documentation for a comprehensive range of emission producing
    activities for use in support of their mandatory greenhouse gas
    reporting requirements. To discover how AMEE supports the data and
    calculation methodologies recommended under this ruling, see
    [here](EPA_GHG_Mandatory_Ruling).

  - **[Climate Leaders](Climate_Leaders) (EPA)**. Climate Leaders is a
    joint EPA-industry programme for reducing corporate impact on the
    environment. Several calculation methodologies and datasets are
    available for calculating greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of
    sources. Details of these methodologies and their implementation in
    the AMEE platform can be found [here](Climate_Leaders).

<!-- end list -->

  - **[E-Grid](US_E_grid) (EPA)**. The EPA E-Grid is a database for
    greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production and
    consumption in each of the subregions of the US.

  - **[Standard Assessment Procedure
    (SAP)](Standard_Assessment_Procedure)**. The Standard Assessment
    Procedure, or SAP, is the UK government adopted methodology for
    calculating the energy performance of dwellings. It is used to
    demonstrate compliance with building regulations, and to provide
    energy performance ratings. To find out how to access the complete
    SAP methodology using AMEE, see
    [here](Standard_Assessment_Procedure).

  - **[European Environment Agency](European_Environment_Agency)**. The
    EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission [inventory
    guidebook](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/EMEPCORINAIR5/)
    (formerly referred to as the EMEP CORINAIR Guidebook) provides
    guidance on estimating emissions from both anthropogenic and natural
    emission sources for the purpose of compiling emissions inventories.
    This manual contains the foremost data and advice on which most
    aviation-based emissions methodologies are based. AMEE represents
    the full emissions calculation methodology for aviation.

  - **[Inventory of carbon and energy
    (ICE)](Embodied_Inventory_of_carbon_and_energy_ICE)**. Professor
    Geoff Hammond and Craig Jones from the Department of Mechanical
    Engineering, University of Bath, have created a database of embodied
    energy and carbon for a large number of building materials. This is
    UK data intended for use in the UK building industry.

  - **[CO<sub>2</sub>Benchmark](CO2_Benchmark)**. AMEE's partners at
    [www.co2benchmark.com](http://www.co2benchmark.com/) produce data on
    the greenhouse gas emissions of individual companies and whole
    business sectors, enabling users to benchmark their own emissions
    against those of others. AMEE provides this data and benchmarking
    functionality for over 90 industrial and commercial sectors. For
    further details, see [here](CO2_Benchmark).

  - **[Centre for Agriculture and Environment
    (CLM)](Centre_for_Agriculture_and_Environment)**. The Centre for
    Agriculture and Environment
    ([CLM](http://www.clm.nl/index_eng.php?)) have developed a
    comprehensive carbon emissions database relating to food
    ingredients, packaging materials, process-energy use, and transport.
    The data allows a user to create an instant life-cycle estimate of
    any food product or menu.

  - **[Ecoinvent](Ecoinvent_database)**. The *ecoinvent Centre* is a
    leading supplier of life cycle inventory data. The ecoinvent
    *database v2.2* offers comprehensive, science-based life cycle
    assessment, management data and services with an international
    scope.

  - **[Carbon Disclosure Project
    (CDP)](CDP_emissions_and_financial_metrics)**. The Carbon Disclosure
    Project is a leading corporate sustainability and transparency
    initiative. Their data documents the performance of companies based
    on absolute emissions and energy consumption as well as emissions
    intensities with respect to financial metrics. This enables
    comparisons by individual company and benchmarking across sectors.
