## 'Heating values'

'Heating values' (or 'calorific values') are measures of the amount of
energy contained within a given quantity of fuel. Heating values are
therefore expressed in terms of *energy per mass* or *energy per volume*
of fuel - e.g. *GJ per t*, *kWh per L*.

Heating values allow the conversion of fuel quantities into their
corresponding quantity of energy. This can be useful for expressing
emissions factors in terms of energy consumed, and therefore making
emissions calculations on the basis of energy consumption rather an
actual physical quantity of fuel.

## Calorific basis

The quantity of energy contained within a fuel can be considered in two
ways. The **total** quantity of energy is indicated by the *higher
heating* or *gross calorific value*. A second measure of energy content
discounts the energy which is required to vaporize any water contained
within the fuel and therefore not realised as heat. This latter measure
is represented by the *lower heatng* or *net calorific* value.

Where no explicit data is available, a conversion between higher and
lower heating values can be made following [IPCC](IPCC) and [Greenhouse
Gas Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) advice, as follows:

Lower heating value = Higher heating value x 1.05; for **solid** and
**liquid** fuels

Lower heating value = Higher heating value x 1.11; for **gaseous** fuels
