The AMEE category for *business/embodied/ICE/concrete* contains data on
the CO,,2,, emissions embodied within various types of concrete.

-----

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

To use this category, use drill-downs to specify the concrete *type*.

### Specifying activity data

Once the type of concrete has been selected, specify the **mass**
profile item.

For reinforced concrete, users can additionally specify the quantity of
steel used (kg steel per m^^3^^ concrete) in the ***massSteel*** profile
item, which is then incorporated into the calculation for embodied
CO,,2,,.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent embodied energy and CO,,2,, emissions
associated with the quantity specified. The following quantities are
returned:

  - ***energy***: embodied energy, in Megajoules, for the concrete
    compnent only
  - ***CO2***: embodied CO,,2,, for both concrete and - where specified
    - reinforcing steel
