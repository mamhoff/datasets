The 'boundaries' represented by each embodied CO<sub>2</sub> factor are
described in AMEE as follows;

  - "Cradle to grave" - embodied CO<sub>2</sub> from entire life cycle of
    material
  - "Cradle to gate" - embodied CO<sub>2</sub> from resource extraction to
    factory gate
  - "Cradle to site" - embodied CO<sub>2</sub> from resource extraction to
    final point of use (e.g. building site)

For reinforced concrete, see [this](Concrete) related methodology.

## How to use this category

### Selecting an emissions scenario

To use this category, use drill-downs to specify the *material*, *type*
and *subtype*.

### Specifying activity data

Next, enter the quantity used using the **mass** profile item.

### Results and calculation

The quantities returned represent embodied energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
associated with the quantity specified. The following quantities are
returned:

  - ***energy***: embodied energy, in Megajoules
  - ***CO2***: embodied CO<sub>2</sub>

## Notes

### Data ranges

Several embodied CO<sub>2</sub> factors presented in ICE are specified as a
range of values. In such cases, AMEE provides the option of choosing
minimum or maximum values.

### Insulation plastics

Data for polystyrene- and polyethylene-based insulation materials are
referenced from the 'plastics' category in ICE.

### Derived CO<sub>2</sub> factors

ICE contains many materials for which only embodied energy is specified.
Only materials which include either (a) an explicit embodied CO<sub>2</sub>
factor, or (b) an embodied *energy* factor plus the associated *energy
fuel split* (from which embodied CO<sub>2</sub> can be derived) are included
within AMEE. The latter method was used to derive embodied CO<sub>2</sub>
factors for *clay/limestone bricks* and *wood-wool reinforced concrete*.
