**Life cycle methodology, window air space fills. Calculates embodied
energy, and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions based on the number of
window units. Scenarios include air, argon, krypton and xenon.
Applicable for UK.**

## Summary

This methodology represents **embodied energy, and carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions** associated with **window air space fills**. The
data and calculation methodology is sourced from the [Inventory of
Carbon & Energy (ICE), version 2.0](http://people.bath.ac.uk/cj219/)
life cycle dataset, produced in conjunction with the University of Bath.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

The methodology is based on factors which describe the quantities of
energy and CO<sub>2</sub> which are 'embodied' within the use of insulating air
space fills in double glazed window units. By multiplying the number of
filled windows under consideration by these factors, an estimate of the
embodied energy and emissions associated with that quantity can be
calculated. These factors assume unit sizes of 1.2 m by 1.2 m.

### Model data

Embodied energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vary between different types of
air space fill. This methodology represents 4 different types: *air*,
*argon*, *krypton* and *xenon*. Each type is represented by two data
values:

  - *embodied energy per filled window unit* (MJ/window)
  - *embodied CO<sub>2</sub> per filled window unit* (kg/window)

In addition, each scenario is described by a **life cycle analysis
boundary**, indicating the stages in the window life cycle which are
represented by the energy and CO2 factors, and in most cases **author
notes** on the sourcing of the data.

### Activity data required

Embodied energy and emissions are directly proportionate to the **number
of filled windows** under consideration, which therefore must be
available in order to calculate.

### Calculation and results

Embodied energy and emissions are calculated by multiplying the
specified number of filled windows by the appropriate factors. Two
values are calculated, representing the embodied **energy** and
**CO<sub>2</sub>** emissions attributable to the specified number of filled
windows.

## Related methodologies

The ICE methodology for [window units](ICE_v2_windows) is separately but
does indeed incorporate the present methodology into calculations for
windows containing particular specified fills.

Several other methodologies sourced from the ICE database are also
available. The bulk of the ICE database represents several hundred
distinct materials, emissions and energy for which can be calculated on
the basis of [mass](ICE_v2_by_mass) or [area](ICE_v2_by_area).

In addition, there exist several methodologies which provide data and
calculations specific to particular types of materials:
[concrete](ICE_v2_concrete) and [timber](ICE_v2_timber) (including
biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions).

Details of the [sources of data](ICE_v2_references) for the ICE database
are also available.
