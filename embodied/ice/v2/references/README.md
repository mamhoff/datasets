**Life cycle dataset, source publication references. Lists sources of
data for ICE life cycle analysis dataset, including title, author(s),
year of publicaiton and ISBN**

## Summary

The [Inventory of Carbon & Energy (ICE),
version 2.0](Embodied_Inventory_of_carbon_and_energy_ICE) is a life
cycle dataset featuring a wide range of construction materials, produced
in conjunction with the University of Bath. This dataset describes the
sources upon which the dataset is based.

-----

## The Dataset

Each of the sources of ICE data are individually itemised, and are
differentiated by their **reference** number or *index*. Each reference
is represented by the following data:

  - *Title*
  - *Author(s)*
  - *Year of publication*
  - *Publisher*
  - *Internation Standard Book Number (ISBN)*

## Related methodologies

These references related to several life-cycle methodologies sourced
from the ICE database.

The bulk of the ICE database represents several hundred distinct
materials, the embodied emissions and energy of which can be calculated
on the basis of [mass](ICE_v2_by_mass) or [area](ICE_v2_by_area).

In addition, there exist several methodologies which provide data and
calculations specific to particular types of materials:
[concrete](ICE_v2_concrete), [timber](ICE_v2_timber) (including biogenic
CO,,2,, emissions) and [windows](ICE_v2_windows).
