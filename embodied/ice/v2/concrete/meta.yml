  replacement: Replacement material and proportion (%)
  energyPerMass: Embodied energy per unit mass of concrete
  massCO2PerMass: Embodied CO<sub>2</sub> per unit mass of concrete
  massCO2ePerMass: Embodied CO<sub>2</sub>e per unit mass of concrete
  boundary: Life cycle analysis boundary, i.e. the stages in the concrete life cycle which are represented by the energy and CO<sub>2</sub> factors
  note: Author notes on the sourcing of data
  mass: Mass of concrete used
  energyPerMassPerSteelDensity: "Embodied energy per unit mass of concrete for each unit density of reinforcing steel. The verbose description of the unit for this quantity is (MJ / kg [concrete]) / (kg [steel] / m^^3^^ [concrete]). This has been rearranged into the more concise form: (MJ m^^3^^) / kg"
  massPerMassPerSteelDensity: "Embodied CO<sub>2</sub> per unit mass of concrete for each unit density of reinforcing steel. The verbose description of the unit for this quantity is (kg [CO<sub>2</sub>] / kg [concrete]) / (kg [steel] / m^^3^^ [concrete]). This has been rearranged into the more concise form: m^^3^^ / kg"
  energyPerMassPrecast: Additional embodied energy per unit mass of concrete for precast concrete
  massPerMassPrecast: Additional embodied CO<sub>2</sub> per unit mass of concrete for precast concrete
  steelDensity: Quantity of reinforcing steel per unit volume of concrete
  isPrecast: Defines whether concrete under consideration is precast. Set to //true// to indicate precasting, otherwise assumed //false//
