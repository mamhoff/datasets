Human powered transport such as walking and cycling produces no direct
carbon dioxide emission. Propellants used by Ariane 5 and the space
shuttle produce no carbon dioxide. Although both do use hypergolic
propellant which does produces carbon dioxide, it is generally used in
relatively small quantities for post-launch manoeuvring, well-above any
layers of the atmosphere that are relevant to climate change.
