The Other regional motorcycle transport category includes data from the
[GHGP worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
Mobile Combustion GHG Emissions Calculation Tool v2.0. This category
allows the user to calculate emissions from a non-UK or US motorcycle
journey depending on the fuel powering the vehicle.

To use this category, the type of vehicle is selected, using the
***vehicleType*** drill-down. The ***distance*** is then set as a
profile item value.

The algorithm returns kg CO,,2,, emitted from the selected journey.

Users can opt to share emissions amongst passengers by setting the
number of passengers using the ***occupancy*** profile item value.
Setting multiple passengers will result in the emissions *per passenger*
being returned. If not set, AMEE will return the emissions assocated
with the entire vehicle.
