This category contains data associated with motorcycle travel in both
European and US contexts, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The data is organised in to geographic subcategories ('europe', 'us'),
within which vehicular emissions are calcuable according to fuel type
and emissions control standards, with emissions estimates for CO2 and
CO2e (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) available.

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with
['mobile
combustion'](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf)
recommend calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the basis of fuel consumed,
whereas those of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O vary more directly with other
factors such as vehicle type, emissions control, frequency of cold
starts, and distance travelled. Therefore, these categories provide a
number of options for calculating motorcycle-associated greenhouse gas
emissions, depending on which combination of fuel consumption, fuel
efficiency and distance are specified.

It should be noted that the US-specific categories are similar to those
within the /transport/motorcycle/generic/ghgp subcategories, in that
both are ultimately derived from similar EPA datasets. The main
difference is that the IPCC methodology maintains the calculation of
CO<sub>2</sub> by *fuel quantity* and CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O by *distance* - as
presented in the original EPA dataset. In contrast, the GHG Protocol
methodology uses *typical mileage* data for each vehicle type in order
to express emissions for all gases on the basis of distance. In
addition, the IPCC data and methodology are organised according to
vehicular emissions control technology rather than vehicle age (although
these are directly related) and include emissions associated with
vehicle 'cold starts' as well as distance travelled.
