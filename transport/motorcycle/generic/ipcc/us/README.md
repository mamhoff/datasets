The AMEE category /transport/motorcycle/generic/ipcc/us contains data on
greenhouse gas emissions associated with motorcycle transport in the US,
sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

Currently, a methodology for conventionally fuelled motorcycles is
available; details can be found
[here](US_conventional_fuel_motorcycle_transport_IPCC)

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with
['mobile
combustion'](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf)
recommend calculating CO,,2,, emissions on the basis of fuel consumed,
whereas those of CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O vary more directly with other
factors such as vehicle type, emissions control standards, and distance
travelled. Therefore, this category provides a number of options for
calculating motorcycle-associated greenhouse gas emissions, depending on
which combination of fuel consumption, fuel efficiency and distance are
specified.
