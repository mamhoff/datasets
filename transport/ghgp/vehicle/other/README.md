**Road vehicle emissions methodology. Calculates direct fossil and/or
biogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide
(N<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions associated
with distance travelled or fuel consumed. Choices include vehicle type,
fuel type and emissions standard. Regions other than the United Kingdom
and United States.**

## Summary

This methodology represents greenhouse gas emissions associated with the
road transport in regions other than the US and UK. The data and
calculation methodology is based on those provided in the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol worksheet *GHG emissions from transport or mobile sources*
(version 2.2), published in June 2011.

## The methodology

### Emissions model

The emissions methodology is based upon emissions factors which describe
the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are produced during
road-based travel in relation to **distance** travelled. These emissions
factors represent emissions associated with *entire vehicles* (e.g. car,
motorcycle), which can be contrasted with similar transport-related
emissions factors which describe emissions on the basis of pssengers or
freight. Emissions for individual passengers can nevertheless be derived
by 'sharing' vehicular emissions across all vehicle occupants, if the
occupancy of the vehicle is known.

Since the CO<sub>2</sub> produced during the burning of biofuels in not a net
contributor to atmospheric warming (see
[here](Carbon_dioxide_emissions)), fossil- and biofuel-associated
CO<sub>2</sub> are explicitly defined.

Emissions - expressed in terms of mass (e.g. kg) - are calculated by
multiplying these rates (mass emitted per distance; e.g. kg CO2 per
mile) by a distance (e.g mile) travelled.

### Model data

The rate at which road transportation produces greenhouse gas emissions
varies with the type of vehicle, depending on factors such as the type
of fuel used (e.g. gasoline/petrol, diesel), the fuel efficiency (i.e.
the distance achieved per unit of fuel consumed) and the presence and
type of emissions control technology employed. Therefore, emissions
factors for a broad range of generalised road transport scenarios are
provided.

A total of 75 specific types of road transport are represented and are
differentiated by vehicle type (i.e. bus, car, light and heavy goods
vehicles, motorcycles), fuel type (gasoline/petrol, diesel, ethanol,
LNG, LPG) and emissions standard. In the case of car, and light and
heavy goods vehicles, the emissions standard is represented by the year
of production. For motorcycles, the emissions standard depends on the
explicit type of technology employed (e.g. non-catalyst control).

Both fossil- and biogenic-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions factors are provided
although the latter is applicable only to those scenarios using
representing the use of ethanol as fuel.

### Activity data required

According to this methodology, greenhouse gas emissions are directly
proportional to the distance travelled, which therefore must be
specified in order to make an emissions calculation.

If multiple passengers are under consideration, this number can be
specified, in which case vehicle emissions are shared amongst all
passengers.

### Calculation and result

The returned quantities for this methodology represent CO<sub>2</sub>, and
biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the activity data (distance)
specified. In most cases CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are entirely represented by
fossil CO<sub>2</sub> as only biofuels (in this case, ethanol) or biofuel
blends contain biogenic carbon.
