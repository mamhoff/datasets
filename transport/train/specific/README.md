The AMEE category /transport/train/specific contains data on the
greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific models of passenger
train. The subcategories found within this category cover both diesel-
and electric-powered vehicles, with coverage of models found in the UK,
Scandanavia and Japan.

## Diesel-powered trains

The AMEE category
[/transport/train/specific/diesel](Specific_diesel_trains) contains data
on emissions associated with diesel powered trains based on testing and
simulations in the UK. The calculation is based on fuel consumption
rates for various diesel train types, with users specifying the distance
travelled, percentage of the train occupied, and the number of
passengers under consideration. Emissions are returned on a *per
passenger* basis.

## Electric-powered trains

The AMEE category
[/transport/train/specific/electric](Specific_electric_trains) contains
data on emissions associated with electric trains based on testing and
simulations in the UK, Scandanavia and Japan. The calculation is based
on energy consumption rates for various electric train types, with users
specifying the distance travelled, percentage of the train occupied, and
the number of passengers under consideration. Users can additionally
specify the country, in which case the appropriate CO,,2,, emissions
factor for electricty generation is used to calculate emissions.
Emissions are returned on a *per passenger* basis.
