The AMEE category /transport/train/route/stations contains details of
train stations which are used in the [Train route](Train_Route)
category.

At present only a single subcategory exists which contains information
on over 2800 UK train stations, including *latitude* and *longitude*,
*station codes* and *postal codes*. This category is for reference only
- being utilised by the category [/transport/train/route](Train_Route)
for establishing journey distances - and therefore profile items should
not be created.
