**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for train freighting can now be found
[here](Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)**

The AMEE category /transport/train/generic/freight/ghgp/other contains
data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the train
transportation of freight in non-US and non-UK contexts, sourced from
the [WRI Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)

To use these categories, select the train type using the *type* drill
down option. Then, specify the distance and mass of the freight
transported by setting the ***distance*** and ***mass*** profile item
values. The value returned represents the total greenhouse gas emissions
(CO,,2,,, CH,,4,,, N,,2,,O) associated with the specified freighting,
expressed in terms of the mass of CO,,2,, which would produce an
equivalent global warming effect.
