**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for train freighting can now be found
[here](Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)**

The AMEE category /transport/train/generic/freight/ghgp/other contains
data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the train
transportation of freight in non-US and non-UK contexts, sourced from
the [WRI Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)

To use these categories, select the train type using the *type* drill
down option. Then, specify the distance and mass of the freight
transported by setting the ***distance*** and ***mass*** profile item
values. The value returned represents the total greenhouse gas emissions
(CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O) associated with the specified freighting,
expressed in terms of the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> which would produce an
equivalent global warming effect.
