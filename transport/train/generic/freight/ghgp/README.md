**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for train freighting can now be found
[here](Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)**

The AMEE category /transport/train/generic/freight/ghgp contains data on
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the train transportation of
freight, sourced from the [WRI Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

Data and calculation methodologies are available for train-based
freighting in two subcategories:

  - [US train freight](US_train_freight)
  - [Other regional train freight](Other_regional_train_freight)
