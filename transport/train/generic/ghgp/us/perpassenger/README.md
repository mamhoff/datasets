Train US per passenger data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
the user to calculate emissions from a US train journey depending on the
distance traveled and the number of passengers.

The user selects the drill-down *type* to select the type of train from
the following options.

  - light rail
  - tram
  - average (light rail and tram)
  - national rail
  - subway

The ***distance*** and ***numberOfPassengers*** are then entered as
profile item values.

The algorithm returns a kg CO<sub>2</sub>e value, which includes CO<sub>2</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions.
