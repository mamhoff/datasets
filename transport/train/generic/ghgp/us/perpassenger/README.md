Train US per passenger data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
the user to calculate emissions from a US train journey depending on the
distance traveled and the number of passengers.

The user selects the drill-down *type* to select the type of train from
the following options.

  - light rail
  - tram
  - average (light rail and tram)
  - national rail
  - subway

The ***distance*** and ***numberOfPassengers*** are then entered as
profile item values.

The algorithm returns a kg CO,,2,,e value, which includes CO,,2,,,
N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions.
