The AMEE category /transport/plane/generic/freight contains data on the
greenhouse gas emissions associated with plane transported freight
sourced from
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting).
See the [WRI Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
subcategories for data and methodologies representing other geographic
scopes.

To use this category, select the type of flight (domestic, short-haul,
long-haul) using the *type* drill down option. Definitions of these, in
terms of distance or duration, are given in the [Generic plane
transport](Generic_plane_transport) documentation. Then, specify the
distance and mass of the freight transported by setting the
***distance*** and ***mass*** profile item values. The returned value
represents the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted in associated with the specified
freighting.
