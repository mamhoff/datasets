The AMEE category /transport/plane/generic/freight/ghgp contains data on
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with plane transported freight
sourced from the [WRI Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

Data and methodologies are organised into two subcategories, based on US
and other regional contexts. See the relevant subcategories for further
details.
