**Reference dataset, airports. Provides airport names, countries and
latitude and longitude references for 500 cities and major destinations
indexed by IATA code. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This dataset provides a reference for 500 world airports, including all
major cities and destinations. The data was original compiled by
[DEFRA](DEFRA_DECC). It is one of two representations of the same
airport database, specifically structured to be searchable via each
airport's *IATA code*. This can be contrasted with the companion
dataset, searchable via [airport country and name](Airports_by_country).

## The dataset

This dataset provides a selective list of 500 global aiports, together
with useful metadata associated with each, including the airport
**name**. **country**, **IATA code** and **latitude** and **longitude**
reference points.

Airports are indexed according to their IATA codes, which provides a
convenient structure for finding and accessing airport data on the basis
of these codes.

This dataset can be used to provide the latitudinal and longitudinal
references for calculating distances between airports.

## Related datasets

This dataset can also be accessed on the basis of [airport country and
name](Airports_by_country). In addition, another dual-access dataset is
available (by [IATA code](All_airports_by_code) or [airport country and
name](All_airports_by_country)) which provides a more comprehensive
(3000) list of global airports but has a lower authority rating than
this dataset.
