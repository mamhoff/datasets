**Reference dataset, airports. Provides airport names, countries and
latitude and longitude references for 3000 airports indexed by IATA
code. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This dataset provides a reference for 3000 world airports sourced from
[partow.net](http://www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/). It
is one of two representations of the same airport database, specifically
structured to be searchable via each airport's *IATA code*. This can be
contrasted with the companion dataset, searchable via [airport country
and name](All_airports_by_country).

## The dataset

This dataset provides a comprehensive list of 3000 global aiports,
together with useful metadata associated with each, including the
airport **name**. **country**, **IATA code** and **latitude** and
**longitude** reference points.

Airports are indexed according to their IATA codes, which provides a
convenient structure for finding and accessing airport data on the basis
of these codes.

This dataset can be used to provide the latitudinal and longitudinal
references for calculating distances between airports.

## Related datasets

This dataset can also be accessed on the basis of [airport country and
name](All_airports_by_country). In addition, another dual-access dataset
is available (by [IATA code](Airports_by_Code) or [airport country and
name](Airports_by_country)) which provides a shortened (500) list of
airports covering all major cities and flight destinations and has a
higher authority rating than this dataset.
