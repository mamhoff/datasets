**Reference dataset, airports. Provides airport names, countries and
latitude and longitude references for 3000 airports indexed by country
and name. Globally applicable.**

## Summary

This dataset provides a reference for 3000 world airports sourced from
[partow.net](http://www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/). It
is one of two representations of the same airport database, specifically
structured to be searchable via each airport's *host country* and
*name*. This can be contrasted with the companion dataset, searchable
via [IATA code](All_airports_by_code).

## The dataset

This dataset provides a comprehensive list of 3000 global aiports,
together with useful metadata associated with each, including the
airport **name**. **country**, **IATA code** and **latitude** and
**longitude** reference points.

Airports are indexed according to their country and name, which provides
a convenient structure for finding and accessing airport data by global
geographic location.

This dataset can be used to provide the latitudinal and longitudinal
references for calculating distances between airports.

## Related datasets

This dataset can also be accessed on the basis of [airport IATA
code](All_airports_by_code). In addition, another dual-access dataset is
available (by [IATA code](Airports_by_Code) or [airport country and
name](Airports_by_country)) which provides a shortened (500) list of
airports covering all major cities and flight destinations and has a
higher authority rating than this dataset.
