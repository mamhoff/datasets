The AMEE category /transport/ship/generic/freight contains data on the
greenhouse gas emissions associated with ship transported freight
sourced from the UK government agency
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/ghg-cf-guidelines2008.pdf).
The following [Ship freighting GHGP](Ship_freighting_GHGP) subcategories
provide ship-based freighting methodologies representing other
geographic contexts sourced from the World Resources Institute
[Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHGP)](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools):

To use this category, select the type of ship using the *type* drill
down option.

Next, specify the distance and mass of the freight transported by
setting the ***distance*** and ***mass*** profile item values. The
returned value represents the mass of CO,,2,, emitted in association
with the specified freighting.
