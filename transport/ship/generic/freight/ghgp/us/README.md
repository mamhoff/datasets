**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for ship freighting can now be found
[/here](Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)**

The AMEE category /transport/ship/generic/freight/ghgp/other contains
data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with ship transported
freight in the US, sourced from the World Resources Institute
[Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHGP)](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

To use this category, select the type of ship using the *type* drill
down option, and specify the size using the *size* drill option.

Next, specify the distance and mass of the freight transported by
setting the ***distance*** and ***mass*** profile item values. The
returned value represents the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted in association
with the specified freighting. In the GHGP subcategories the returned
value also incorporates CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, all expressed
together as the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> which would provide an equivalent global
warming effect.
