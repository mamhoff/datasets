The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/freight/ghgp/us/heavyduty
contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the heavy
duty road transportation of freight in the US, sourced from the [WRI
Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

The calculation methodology uses *per distance, per mass* emissions
factors, and thus emissions represent those associated with the road
freighting of a specific quantity of freight.

To use this category, select the vehicle type and size using the
*vehicleType* and *size* drill down options. Then, specify the distance
and mass of the freight transported by setting the ***distance*** and
***mass*** profile item values. The value returned represents the total
greenhouse gas emissions (CO,,2,,, CH,,4,,, N,,2,,O) associated with the
specified freighting, expressed in terms of the mass of CO,,2,, which
would produce an equivalent global warming effect.
