The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/freight/ghgp/us/heavyduty
contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the heavy
duty road transportation of freight in the US, sourced from the [WRI
Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

The calculation methodology uses *per distance, per mass* emissions
factors, and thus emissions represent those associated with the road
freighting of a specific quantity of freight.

To use this category, select the vehicle type and size using the
*vehicleType* and *size* drill down options. Then, specify the distance
and mass of the freight transported by setting the ***distance*** and
***mass*** profile item values. The value returned represents the total
greenhouse gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O) associated with the
specified freighting, expressed in terms of the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> which
would produce an equivalent global warming effect.
