The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/freight/ghgp contains data on
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the road transportation of
freight, sourced from the [WRI Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).

The data and calculation methodologies within these categories are based
on distance- and mass-based emissions factors and therefore represented
emissions per quantity of freight transported.

Subcategories are organised by geographic context ('US', 'other'
(non-US/UK)). See the relevant subcategory documentation for further
details.
