**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for goods vehicle transport can now be found at the following:**

  - [US](US_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [UK (light goods)](UK_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [UK (heavy
    goods)](UK_heavy_goods_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [Other
    regions](Other_regional_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)

This section covers all sub-categories relating to large goods
transportation that use data from the World Resources Institute
[GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/). The data and calculation
methodologies within these categories are based on distance-based
emissions factors and therefore represented *per vehicle* emissions.
Should users wish to calculated emissions per unit of freight
transported, they are referred to the AMEE [Road
freighting](Road_freighting) category.

Subcategories for GHGP large goods vehicle methodologies are organised
by vehicle type ('heavy duty', 'light goods'), and geographic context
('US', 'other' (non-US/UK)) and include functionality for calculating
biofuel emissions separately from those associated with fossil fuels.

See the appropriate subcategory documentation for specific details.
