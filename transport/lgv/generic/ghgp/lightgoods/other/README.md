**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for other regional light goods vehicle transport can now be found
[here](Other_regional_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)**

The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/lightgoods/other contains
data on emissions associated with light goods trucks in non-US or UK
contexts sourced from the [GHGP
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools), and
allows the user to calculate emissions depending on vehicle fuel type.

Firstly the fuel type from the following options using the *fuelType*
drill option:

  - lpg
  - diesel
  - gasoline

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value, with the
algorithm returning a value for kg CO,,2,, emitted according to the fuel
type and distance specified.

## Biomass fuel

The GHG protocol requires CO,,2,, emissions from biomass fuels to be
reported on differently, due to the fact that the CO,,2,, released from
biomass fuels has only recently been sequestered from the atmosphere and
so does not constitute a net increase in CO,,2,,, unlike fossil fuel
emissions or those of CH,,4,, and N,,2,,. Therefore, the CO,,2,,
emissions for ethanol are not included here, but can be found in the
[biofuel](Other_regional_light_goods_biofuel_truck) subcategory.
