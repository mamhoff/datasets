The AMEE category
/transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/lightgoods/other/biomassfuel contains data
sourced from the World Resources Institute
[GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
for calculating emissions associated with light goods biofuel trucks in
non-US or UK contexts. This allows users to calculate their biofuel
CO,,2,, emissions separately from the fossil fuel CO,,2,, emissions
calculated in the [Other regional light goods
truck](Other_regional_light_goods_truck) category.

To use this category, specify the biofuel type using the *fuelType*
drill-down. At present the only option for biomass fuels in this
category is 'ethanol'.

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value by the user.

The algorithm returns the kg CO,,2,, for the distance and biofuel type
specified.
