**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for light goods vehicle transport can now be found at the following:**

This category contains a number of subcategories containing data on
emissions associated with light goods vehicles sourced from the World
Resources Institute [GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/). The
data and calculation methodologies are based on distance-based emissions
factors and therefore represent *per vehicle* emissions. Should user
wish to calculated emissions per unit of freight transported, they are
referred to the AMEE [Road freighting](Road_freighting) category.

Subcategories herein are organised by geographic context ('US', 'other'
(non-US/UK)) and include functionality for calculating biofuel emissions
separately from those associated with fossil fuels.
