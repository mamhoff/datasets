The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/lightgoods/us/biomassfuel
contains data sourced from the World Resources Institute
[GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
for calculating emissions associated with light goods biofuel trucks in
the US. This allows users to calculate their biofuel CO,,2,, emissions
separately from the fossil fuel CO,,2,,, N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions
in the [US light goods truck](US_light_goods_truck) category.

To use this category, specify the biofuel type using the *fuelType*
drill-down. At present the only option for biomass fuels in this
category is 'ethanol'.

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value by the user.

The algorithm returns the kg CO,,2,, for the distance and biofuel type
specified. This CO,,2,, value covers biomass emissions only. CH,,4,, and
N,,2,,O emissions are included in the [US light goods
truck](US_light_goods_truck) category. If the user wishes to calculate
complete emissions, including biomass and fossil CO,,2,, emissions (as
well as CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions), both categories should be used.
