**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for heavy goods vehicle transport can now be found at the following:**

  - [US](US_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [UK](UK_heavy_goods_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [Other
    regions](Other_regional_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)

This category contains subcategories relating to heavy duty vehicle
transport data from the [|GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/).
The data and calculation methodologies are based on distance-based
emissions factors and therefore represented *per vehicle* emissions.

The subcategories are organised by geographic context ('US', 'other'
(non-US/UK)) and include functionality for calculating biofuel emissions
separately from those associated with fossil fuels.
