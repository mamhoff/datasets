The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/heavyduty/other contains
data on emissions associated with heavy duty trucks in non-US or UK
contexts sourced from the [GHGP
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools), and
allows the user to calculate emissions depending on the type and fuel of
the vehicle.

Firstly the type of vehicle is specified, using the *vehicleType*
drill-down, from either 'rigid' or 'articulated'. Then use the
*fuelType* drill-down to specify the fuel type from the following
options.

  - lng
  - lpg
  - diesel
  - gasoline

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value.

The algorithm returns kg CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the vehicle/fuel type and
distance specified.

## Biomass fuel

The GHG protocol requires CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass fuels to be
reported on differently, due to the fact that the CO<sub>2</sub> released from
biomass fuels has only recently been sequestered from the atmosphere and
so does not constitute a net increase in CO<sub>2</sub>, unlike fossil fuel
emissions or those of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions for ethanol are not included here, but can be found in the
[biofuel](Other_regional_heavy_duty_biofuel_truck) subcategory.
