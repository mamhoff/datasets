**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for other regional heavy goods vehicle transport can now be found

The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/heavyduty/other contains
data on emissions associated with heavy duty trucks in non-US or UK
contexts sourced from the [GHGP
Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools), and
allows the user to calculate emissions depending on the type and fuel of
the vehicle.

Firstly the type of vehicle is specified, using the *vehicleType*
drill-down, from either 'rigid' or 'articulated'. Then use the
*fuelType* drill-down to specify the fuel type from the following
options.

  - lng
  - lpg
  - diesel
  - gasoline

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value.

The algorithm returns kg CO,,2,, emissions for the vehicle/fuel type and
distance specified.

## Biomass fuel

The GHG protocol requires CO,,2,, emissions from biomass fuels to be
reported on differently, due to the fact that the CO,,2,, released from
biomass fuels has only recently been sequestered from the atmosphere and
so does not constitute a net increase in CO,,2,,, unlike fossil fuel
emissions or those of CH,,4,, and N,,2,,. Therefore, the CO,,2,,
emissions for ethanol are not included here, but can be found in the
[biofuel](Other_regional_heavy_duty_biofuel_truck) subcategory.
