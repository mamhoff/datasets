The AMEE category
/transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/heavyduty/other/biomassfuel contains data
sourced from the World Resources Institute
[GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
for calculating emissions associated with heavy duty biofuel trucks in
non-US or UK contexts. This allows users to calculate their biofuel
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions separately from the fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
calculations in the [Other regional heavy duty
truck](Other_regional_heavy_duty_truck) category.

To use this category, specify the vehicle type using the *vehicleType*
drill-down, from ''rigid'' or ''articulated''. Then use the *fuelType*
drill-down to select the type of fuel being used. At present the only
option for biomass fuels in this category is 'ethanol'.

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item by the user.

The algorithm returns the kg CO<sub>2</sub> emitted according to the vehicle,
fuel type and distance specified. This CO<sub>2</sub> value covers biomass
emissions only.
