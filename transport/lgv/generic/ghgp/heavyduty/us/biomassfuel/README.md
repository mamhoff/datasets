The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/heavyduty/us/biomassfuel
contains data sourced from the World Resources Institute
[GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
for calculating emissions associated with heavy duty biofuel trucks in
the US. This allows users to calculate their biofuel CO,,2,, emissions
separately from the fossil fuel CO,,2,,, N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions
in the [US heavy duty truck](US_heavy_duty_truck) category.

To use this category, specify the vehicle type using the *vehicleType*
drill-down, from ''rigid'' or ''articulated''. Then use the *fuelType*
drill-down to select the type of fuel being used. At present the only
option for biomass fuels in this category is 'ethanol'.

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item by the user.

The algorithm returns the kg CO,,2,, for the distance entered. This
CO,,2,, value covers biomass emissions only. CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O
emissions are included in the [US heavy duty truck](US_heavy_duty_truck)
category. If the user wishes to calculate complete emissions, including
biomass and fossil CO,,2,, emissions (as well as CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O
emissions), both categories should be used.
