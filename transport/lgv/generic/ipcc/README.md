This category contains data associated with large goods vehicle in both
European and US contexts, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The data is organised in to geographic subcategories ('europe', 'us'),
within which vehicular emissions are calcuable according to fuel type
and emissions control standards, with emissions estimates for CO,,2,,
and CO2e (i.e. CO,,2,,, CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O) available.

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with
['mobile
combustion'](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf)
recommend calculating CO,,2,, emissions on the basis of fuel consumed,
whereas those of CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O vary more directly with other
factors such as vehicle type, emissions control, frequency of cold
starts, and distance travelled. Therefore, these categories provide a
number of options for calculating large goods vehicle-associated
greenhouse gas emissions, depending on which combination of fuel
consumption, fuel efficiency and distance are specified.

It should be noted that the US-specific categories are similar to those
within the /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/heavygoods subcategories, in that
both are derived from similar EPA datasets. The main differences reflect
the organisation of vehicle type and the basis on which CO,,2,, and
non-CO,,2,, emissions are calculated (i.e. by *fuel* or *distance*).
