The AMEE category /transport/taxi/generic contains a single
representative vehicle type, based on the 'large, diesel' vehicle used
in the [Generic car](Generic_car_transport) category, and returns
emissions on a *per vehicle* basis. For *per passenger* emissions, see
the subcategories below.

To use this category, specify the taxi type using *type* drill option
(there currently exists only one choice here: 'typical'). Next, specify
the distance travelled using the ***distance*** profile item value. The
value returned represents the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with
taxi transport across the distance specified.
