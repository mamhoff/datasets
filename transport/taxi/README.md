The AMEE category /transport/taxi contains several subcategories which
provide emissions methodologies in relation to taxi transport. All
current taxi-associated methodologies concern representative taxi
scenarios and are thus found within the /transport/taxi/generic
subcategory. Details of each generic subcategory are as follows.

## Generic taxi transport

The AMEE category [Generic taxi transport](Generic_taxi_transport)
contains a single representative vehicle type, based on the 'large,
diesel' vehicle used in the [Generic car](Generic_car_transport)
category. The associated emissions calculation uses a *per distance*
emissions factor (i.e. kg CO<sub>2</sub> per km) and therefore represents
emissions based on an entire vehicle journey (which can be contrasted
with the *per passenger* emissions provided by the other currently
existing taxi categories). Users need only specify a distance therefore
to make an emissions calculation using this category.

## Per passenger taxi

The [Per passenger taxi transport](Per_passenger_taxi_transport)
category contains greenhouse gas emissions data relating to taxi travel,
sourced from the UK government agency
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm).
The methodology uses distance-based, *per passenger* emissions factors,
requiring the user to specify the distance travelled. Users may
calculate according to single 'one-off' journeys, or by repeated
journeys.

## Generic taxi GHGP

The [Generic taxi transport GHGP](Generic_taxi_transport_GHGP) contains
greenhouse gas emissions data relating to taxi travel, sourced from the
latest [GHGP
documentation](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools).
This category provides *per passenger* emissions calculation for taxi
travel in the specific context of the United States. User are required
to specify the journey distance and number of passengers, with the
returned value representing greenhouse gas emissions attributable to all
passengers, inclusive of the greenhouse gases CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O (expressed as CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent).
