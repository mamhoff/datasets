**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for car transport can now be found at the following:**

  - [US](US_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [UK](UK_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [Other
    regions](Other_regional_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)

The AMEE category /transport/car/generic/ghgp contains car-associated
emissions data sourced from the latest
[GHG\_Protocol](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/) documentation. The data and
methodologies are organised into subcategories representing car travel
in the context of the United States and 'other' (i.e. non-US and non-UK)
regions. See the appropriate subcategory for further information
