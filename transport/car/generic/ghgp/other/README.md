The Other regional car transport category represent data and methodology
from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools)
Mobile Combustion GHG Emissions Calculation Tool v2.0, and allows the
user to calculate emissions from a non-UK or US car journey depending on
the fuel powering the car.

To use this category, the user selects the fuel type using the
*fuelType* drill option, from the following options.

  - diesel
  - gasoline

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value.

The algorithm returns a kg CO<sub>2</sub> value for the selected distance and
vehicle type.

Users can opt to share emissions amongst passengers by setting the
number of passengers using the ***occupancy*** profile item value.
Setting multiple passengers will result in the emissions *per passenger*
being returned. If not set, AMEE will return the emissions assocated
with the entire vehicle.
