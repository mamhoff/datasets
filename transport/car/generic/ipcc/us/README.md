This category contains data associated with car-travel in the US,
sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The data is organised into fuel types ('conventional', 'alternative'),
with emissions estimates for CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>e (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>
and N<sub>2</sub>O) available.

It should be noted that the US-specific categories are similar to those
within the /transport/car/generic/ghgp subcategories, in that both are
ultimately derived from similar EPA datasets. The main difference is
that the IPCC methodology maintains the calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> by *fuel
quantity* and CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O by *distance* - as presented in the
original EPA dataset. In contrast, the GHG Protocol methodology uses
*typical mileage* data for each vehicle type in order to express
emissions for all gases on the basis of distance. In addition, the IPCC
data and methodology are organised according to vehicular emissions
control technology rather than vehicle age (although these are directly
related) and include emissions associated with vehicle 'cold starts' as
well as distance travelled.
