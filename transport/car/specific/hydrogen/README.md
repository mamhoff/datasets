The AMEE category transport/car/specific/hydrogen contains data on the
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with specific models of hydrogen powered
car.

To use this category, use drill downs to specify the manufacturer
(*manufacturer*) and model (*line*) of car and set the distance
travelled using the ***distance*** profile item value. By default, the
returned value will represent greenhouse gas emissions associated with
the specified distance on a *per vehicle* basis. However, if the
***occupants*** profile item value is set to a positive integer (its
default is -1), then the returned amount will be 'shared' among
passengers and will represent emissions on a *per occupant* basis.
