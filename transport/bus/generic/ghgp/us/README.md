**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for bus transport can now be found
[here](US_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)**

Bus generic US data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
the user to calculate emissions from a bus journey on a *per vehicle*
basis, while the /perpassenger subcategory contains emissions
calculations on a *per passenger* basis.

To use this category select the type of bus fuel from the following
options using the drill-down *fuelType*:

  - cng
  - ethanol
  - diesel
  - gasoline

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value. The algorithm
returns a sum of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions for the fuel
type and distance specified.******

## Biomass fuels

The GHG protocol requires CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass fuels to be
reported separately, due to the fact that the CO<sub>2</sub> released from
biomass fuels has only recently been sequestered from the atmosphere and
so does not constitute a net increase in CO<sub>2</sub>, unlike fossil fuel
emissions or those of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, only the CH<sub>4</sub>
and N<sub>2</sub> emissions for ethanol are included here, while the associated
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be found in the
[biomass](US_biofuel_bus_transport) subcategory. If the user wishes to
calculate their total GHG emissions from ethanol-powered bus travel
(i.e. including the biomass CO2 component), they should use both
categories in combination.
