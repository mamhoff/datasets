This data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
the user to calculate emissions from a US bus journey on a *per
passenger* basis, depending on the distance traveled. The user selects
the drill-down *type* to select the type of bus from the following
options.

  - local bus
  - coach

The ***distance*** and ***numberOfPassengers*** are then entered as
profile item values.

The algorithm returns a kg CO,,2,,e value, which represents CO,,2,,,
N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions for the distance and number of passengers
specified.
