Bus generic US biomass fuel data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
users to calculate their biomass CO<sub>2</sub> emissions separately from the
fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions which can be
calculated using the [US bus transport](US_bus_transport) category.

The user selects the drill-down *fuelType* to select the type of fuel
being used. At present the only option for biomass fuels in this
category is *ethanol*. The *distance* is then set as a profile item by
the user.

The algorithm returns the kg CO<sub>2</sub> for the distance entered. This
CO<sub>2</sub> value covers biomass emissions only. CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O
emissions for ethanol-powered bus travel are included in the [US bus
transport](US_bus_transport) category. If the user wishes to calculate
complete emissions, including biomass CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, both categories
must be used.
