The category /transport/bus/generic/ghgp contains data on bus-associated
emissions sourced from the latest World Resources Institute [Greenhouse
Gas Protocol (GHGP)](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp)
documentation.This category includes emissions methodologies for bus
travel in several geographic contexts, and includes both *per vehicle*
and *per passenger* emissions factors. This category also features
separate functionality for calculating biofuel emissions.
