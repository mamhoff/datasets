**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies
for bus transport can now be found at the following:**

  - [//Per passenger// methodology for US, UK and other
    regions](Passenger_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)
  - [//Per vehicle// methodology for other
    regions](Other_regional_road_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol)

Bus generic other regions data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
the user to calculate emissions from a non-UK or US bus journey
depending on the fuel powering the bus. The user selects the drill-down
*fuelType* from the following options.

  - diesel
  - gasoline

The ***distance*** is then set as a profile item value.

The algorithm returns the kg CO,,2,, emitted from a journey of the given
distance.

## Biomass fuels

The GHG protocol requires CO,,2,, emissions from biomass fuels to be
reported on differently, due to the fact that the CO,,2,, released from
biomass fuels has only recently been sequestered from the atmosphere so
does not constitute a net increase in CO,,2,,, unlike fossil fuel
CO,,2,, emissions. Therefore, the CO,,2,, emissions for ethanol are not
included here, but can be found in the
[biomass](Other_regional_biofuel_bus_transport) subcategory.
