This data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
users to calculate their biomass CO,,2,, emissions separately from the
fossil fuel CO,,2,,, N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions which can be
calculated using the [Other regional bus
transport](Other_regional_bus_transport) category.

The user selects the drill-down *fuelType* to select the type of fuel
being used. At present the only option for biomass fuels in this
category is *ethanol*. The *distance* is then set as a profile item by
the user.

The algorithm returns the kg CO,,2,, for the distance entered. This
CO,,2,, value covers biomass emissions only. CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O
emissions for ethanol-powered bus travel are included in the [Other
regional bus transport](Other_regional_bus_transport) category. If the
user wishes to calculate complete emissions, including biomass CO,,2,,
emissions, both categories must be used.
