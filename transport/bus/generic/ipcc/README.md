US bus transport can be found [here](European_road_transport_by_IPCC)
and [here](US_road_transport_with_alternative_fuels_by_IPCC)
respectively**

This category contains data associated with bus-travel in both European
and US contexts, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The data is organised in to geographic subcategories ('europe', 'us'),
within which vehicular emissions are calcuable according to fuel type
and emissions control standards, with emissions estimates for CO<sub>2</sub>
and CO<sub>2</sub>e (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) available.

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with
['mobile
combustion'](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf)
recommend calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the basis of fuel consumed,
whereas those of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O vary more directly with other
factors such as vehicle type, emissions control, frequency of cold
starts, and distance travelled. Therefore, these categories provide a
number of options for calculating bus-associated greenhouse gas
emissions, depending on which combination of fuel consumption, fuel
efficiency and distance are specified.

It should be noted that the US-specific categories are similar to those
within the /transport/bus/generic/ghgp subcategories, in that both are
ultimately derived from similar EPA datasets. The main difference is
that the IPCC methodology maintains the calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> by *fuel
quantity* and CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O by *distance* - as presented in the
original EPA dataset. In contrast, the GHG Protocol methodology uses
*typical mileage* data for each vehicle type in order to express
emissions for all gases on the basis of distance.
