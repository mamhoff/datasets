This category contains data associated with bus-travel in the US,
sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with
['mobile
combustion'](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf)
recommend calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the basis of fuel consumed,
whereas those of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O vary more directly with other
factors such as vehicle type, emissions control, frequency of cold
starts, and distance travelled. Therefore, these categories provide a
number of options for calculating bus-associated greenhouse gas
emissions, depending on which combination of fuel consumption, fuel
efficiency and distance are specified.

It should be noted that these categories are similar to those within the
/transport/bus/generic/ghgp subcategories, in that both are ultimately
derived from similar EPA datasets. The main difference is that the IPCC
methodology maintains the calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> by *fuel quantity* and
CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O by *distance* - as presented in the original EPA
dataset. In contrast, the GHG Protocol methodology uses *typical
mileage* data for each vehicle type in order to express emissions for
all gases on the basis of distance.

The data and methodology are located in a single subcategory
representing buses using 'alternative' fuels (e.g. ethanol, cng):
