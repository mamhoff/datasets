The AMEE category at ''/transport/bus/generic/occupancy'' includes data
for bus transport which allows you to set the expected occupancy and
number of accounted passengers of bus transport. This makes it possible
to share out the carbon cost of the vehicle across users. It is based on
the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) worksheet
''CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport or mobile sources'' (v1.3), with one
additional data item taken from the NAEI. As the GHG protocol permits
users to specify their own emissions factors, a protocol compliant tool
may use any of these factors.

To use this category, use a drill-down to specify the ***context*** (bus
type and/or source) for the vehicle used.

Once the ***context*** has been chosen, specify the following profile
values for your item:

  - ***distance***
  - ***accountedPassengers***
  - ***occupancy***

The per-vehicle-distance carbon dioxide produced by the vehicle is
shared across all passengers, so by specifying ***occupancy*** and
***accountedPassengers*** a fair reckoning of your users' carbon output
can be made.
