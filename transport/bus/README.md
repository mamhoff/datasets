The AMEE category /transport/bus contains data on greenhouse gas
emissions associated with bus travel. All subcategories are based on
*generic* emissions factors, describing greenhouse gas emissions in
terms of journey distances for distinct representative types of bus
travel.

The following subcategories are available in the /transport/bus
category.

## Generic bus transport

The category [/transport/bus/generic](Generic_bus_transport) contains
passenger-based emissions data relating to bus travel in the UK and the
Republic of Ireland, with sources including the UK government agency
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm).
This category measures CO<sub>2</sub> emissions only, and should be considered
to represent a useful first point of entry to bus-related emissions.
This category is used by the UK Goverment [Act On
CO<sub>2</sub>](http://actonco2.direct.gov.uk/actonco2/home.html) website.

## Generic bus transport - DEFRA

The AMEE [DEFRA Generic bus transport](Bus_generic_Defra) category
contains the most recently published
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm)
data on greenhouse gas emissions associated with representative
passenger bus types in UK. The methodology uses distance-based, *per
passenger* emissions factors, requiring the user to specify the distance
travelled. This category includes CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions
as part of each calculation.

## Generic bus transport - GHG Protocol

The category [/transport/bus/generic/ghgp](Generic_bus_transport_GHGP)
contains data on bus-associated emissions sourced from the latest World
Resources Institute [Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHGP)](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp) documentation. This
category includes emissions methodologies for bus travel in several
geographic contexts, and includes both *per vehicle* and *per passenger*
emissions factors. This category also features separate functionality
for calculating biofuel emissions.

## Generic bus transport - IPCC

The category [/transport/bus/generic/ipcc](Generic_bus_transport_IPCC)
contains data on bus-associated emissions sourced from the IPCC
[Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/). This category contains
data and methodologies for bus travel in European and US contexts and
calclulates emissions on per vehicle basis, using fuel consumption or a
combination of fuel consumption, fuel efficiency and distance.

## Bus travel with occupancy

The category [/transport/bus/generic/occupancy](Bus_by_occupancy) also
contains older GHGP data for several types of bus transport. The
category is based around *per vehicle* emissions factors but includes a
facility for specifying both *total vehicle occupancy* and the *number
of passengers accountable*, in order to accurately determine the share
of vehicular emissions attributable to passengers under the user's
consideration.
