The AMEE category at ''/transport/byDistance/freight'' includes data for
carriage of freight taken from parts of the [Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) worksheet ''CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
transport or mobile sources'' (v1.3)

To use this category, use drill-downs to specify the ***type*** and
***subtype*** for the vehicle used. The GHG protocol provides
alternative emission factors for transport compiled from a number of
sources, as indicated in the worksheet.

Once the type and context have been chosen, specify the following
profile values for your item:

  - ***distance***
  - ***mass***

There are some [ additional categories](Transport%20) in AMEE for
freight. Because these are based on per-mass-distance emission factors,
and the GHG protocol permits users to define their own emissions
factors, a GHGP compliant tool may also use these categories.
