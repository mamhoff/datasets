This data is from the [GHGP
worksheet](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools) GHG
emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows
the user to calculate emissions based on the amount of fuel used in a
particular journey. The user selects the drill-down *fuelType* from the
following options.

  - e85 ethanol/gasoline
  - b20 biodiesel/diesel
  - ethanol
  - 100% biodiesel

The *fuelQuantity* for the journey is then specified as a profile item
value.

The algorithm returns a CO<sub>2</sub> value based on the users specifications
and certain fuel emission factors. This CO<sub>2</sub> value covers biomass
emissions only. Therefore, the fossil fuel components of E85 and B20 are
not included here, but are in the [parent
category](Other_regional_transport_fuel). If the user wishes to
calculate complete emissions, including biomass CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, both
categories must be used.
