The AMEE category at /transport/byFuel includes data for the mobile
burning of a variety of fuels taken from parts of several of the
[Greenhouse Gas Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) worksheets. **See
below for details on subcategories with alternative fuel-based data and
methodologies**.

The primary category contains data on greenhouse gas emissions
associated with numerous types of fuel when burned in the context of
transportation. Alternative emissions factors are available for each
fuel type, from sources including the [IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/), the
UK government agency [DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/), and the US
[Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.doe.gov/). Users have
the option of specifying fuel quantities in terms of energy, volume or
mass.

Data for the mobile burning of fuels within this category is taken from
parts of several of the [Greenhouse Gas
Protocol](Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol) worksheets, inclduing.

  - CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport or mobile sources (v1.3)

<!-- end list -->

  - Emissions from employee commuting (v2.0)

<!-- end list -->

  - CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from business travel (v2.0)

<!-- end list -->

  - GHG emissions from pulp and paper mills (v1.3)

To use this category, use drill-downs to specify the ***fuel*** type
burned and the ***version*** of the emission factor you wish to use. The
GHG protocol provides alternative emission factors for several fuels
based on a number of sources:

  - ***IPCC99***, the [Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National
    Greenhouse Gas
    Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs5.html)
    (This source is referred to as IPCC99 in the GHGP's worksheet)

<!-- end list -->

  - ***IPCC06***, the [2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
    Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html)
    (Also used for gasoline/petrol figures for specific engine types)

<!-- end list -->

  - ***IPCC 06, CO<sub>2</sub>e***, ***ibid***, including nitrous oxide and
    methane emissions.

<!-- end list -->

  - ***EIA***, the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases
    Program](http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/coefficients.html)

<!-- end list -->

  - ***DEFRA***, the [UK DEFRA Guidelines for Company Reporting on
    Greenhouse Gas
    Emissions](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting)

<!-- end list -->

  - Country values for coal - UNEP Guidelines 2000

Once the ***fuel*** and ***version*** have been chosen, specify any one
of the following profile values for your item:

  - ***NRG***
  - ***Mass***
  - ***Volume***

(Do not use more than one of NRG, mass and volume)

Note that these figures are for technologies typically used for mobile
combustion in transport. For stationary combustion of the same fuels,
see [Stationary\_Combustion](Stationary_Combustion)
