**This category is deprecated. The IPCC methodologies for US light goods
transport can be found [here](US_road_transport_by_IPCC) and
[here](US_road_transport_with_alternative_fuels_by_IPCC)**

This category contains data associated with light goods transport in the
US, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The data is organised in to fuel types ('conventional', 'alternative'),
with emissions estimates for CO,,2,, and CO,,2,,e (i.e. CO,,2,,, CH,,4,,
and N,,2,,O) available.

It should be noted that the US-specific categories are similar to those
within the /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/lightgoods subcategories, in that
both are ultimately derived from the same EPA dataset. However, the IPCC
data and methodology are organised according to vehicular emissions
control technology rather than vehicle age (although these are directly
related) and include emissions associated with vehicle 'cold starts' as
well as distance travelled.
