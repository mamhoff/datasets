This category contains data associated with van transport in both
European and US contexts, sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/).

The data is organised in to geographic subcategories ('europe', 'us'),
within which vehicular emissions are calcuable according to fuel type
and emissions control standards, with emissions estimates for CO<sub>2</sub>
and CO<sub>2</sub>e (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) available.

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with
['mobile
combustion'](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf)
recommend calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the basis of fuel consumed,
whereas those of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O vary more directly with other
factors such as vehicle type, emissions control, frequency of cold
starts, and distance travelled. Therefore, these categories provide a
number of options for calculating van-associated greenhouse gas
emissions, depending on which combination of fuel consumption, fuel
efficiency and distance are specified.

It should be noted that the US-specific categories are similar to those
within the /transport/lgv/generic/ghgp/lightgoods subcategories, in that
both are ultimately derived from the same EPA dataset. However, the IPCC
data and methodology are organised according to vehicular emissions
control technology rather than vehicle age (although these are directly
related) and include emissions associated with vehicle 'cold starts' as
well as distance travelled.
