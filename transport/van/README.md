The AMEE category /transport/van contains data associated with the
greenhouse gas emissions of van transport. Van-associated data is
currently available in the following subcategory:

## Generic van

The AMEE category [/transport/van/generic](Generic_van_transport)
contains data associated with the greenhouse gas emissions of
representative van types. The data and methodology is sourced from
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm)
with emissions calculations made on on the basis of distance travelled,
with the option of specifying vehicle fuel consumption for the most
accurate results. This category measures CO<sub>2</sub> emissions only and
should be considered to represent a useful first point of entry to
van-related emissions.

## Generic bus transport - DEFRA

The AMEE [DEFRA generic van transport](Van_generic_Defra) category
contains the most recently published
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm)
data on greenhouse gas emissions associated with representative van
types in UK. The methodology uses distance-based, *per vehicle*
emissions factors, requiring the user to specify the distance travelled.
This category includes CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions as part of
each calculation.

## Generic van transport - GHG Protocol

The category [GHGP light goods vehicles](Light_goods_truck_transport)
contains data on van-associated emissions sourced from the latest World
Resources Institute [Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHGP)](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp) documentation. This
category includes emissions methodologies for light goods transport in
several geographic contexts, and a separate functionality for
calculating biofuel emissions.

## Generic bus transport - IPCC

The category [IPCC generic van transport](Generic_van_transport_IPCC)
contains data on van-associated emissions sourced from the IPCC
[Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/). This category contains
data and methodologies for van transport in European and US contexts and
calclulates emissions on per vehicle basis, using fuel consumption or a
combination of fuel consumption, fuel efficiency and distance.

## Van freighting

The category [Van freighting](Van_Freight) contains data on
van-associated freighting emissions, sourced from the most recently
published
[DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm)
data. The methodologies provided in this category calculate emissions on
per unit mass of freight transported, and therefore require values for
mass and distance to be specified by the user.
