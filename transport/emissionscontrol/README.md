This category contains data associated vehicular emissions control
technologies. There is currently one subcategory providing a methodology
sourced from the IPCC [Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories](http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/) for calculating
non-combustive CO,,2,, emissions from urea-based catalytic converters.

See the [Urea\_based\_additives](Urea_based_additives) page for more
information.
