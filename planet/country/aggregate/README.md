The aggregate category contains data on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions aggregated by
country and global region. Values represent all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
related to the combustion and flaring of fossil fuels.

The data provides aggregate (Mt/yr) and per capita (t/yr) CO<sub>2</sub>
emission rates (2006), cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the period
1850-2004, as well as an index of change since 1996, for all countries
and 8 geographic regions. In addition, countries are ranked in terms of
their aggregate annual (2005) CO<sub>2</sub> production.

All data is sourced from the US government Energy Information
Administration, except for the 1850-2004 cumulative data which is
sourced from the World Resources Institute.
