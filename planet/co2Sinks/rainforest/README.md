This section allows the user to get a rough idea of how much rainforest
is required to absorb a given amount of CO,,2,, emissions. Because there
is considerable uncertainty regarding the CO,,2,, absorption rate of
rainforest, we anticipate including several choices of value in this
category. The drill-down ***sourceName*** is used in this category to
chose which source the user would prefer to use in the calculations. At
present the only option for this drill-down is *Save the Rainforest*.

The user then enters either ***co2Quantity*** or ***rainforestArea*** as
profile item values. If the area of rainforest is entered then AMEE
returns an amount of CO,,2,, as usual. This is the amount of CO,,2,,
that would be absorbed by that area of rainforest in one year. When
storing calculations via profiles, if the amount of CO,,2,, is entered
then AMEE returns the area of rainforest (in kmÂ²) that would take one
year to absorb that amount of CO,,2,, in the profile item value
***rainforestArea***.

The value with ***sourceName***=*Save the Rainforest* is provided by the
Princes Rainforest Project and Save the Rainforests. It should be
treated as being indicative only as several important assumptions have
been made, for example, concerning the latitude and climate of the
forest's location, which are significant in determining the amount of
carbon dioxide absorbed.
