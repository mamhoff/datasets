The AMEE category at /planet/oxidationfactors contains default factors
for the level of oxidation achieved in the combustion of several types
of fuel. The data is sourced from a number of separate sources,
aggregated by the International Council of Forest and Paper Associations
([ICFPA](http://www.wbcsd.org/web/projects/forestry/Pulp-and-Paper-Tool-Guidance.pdf)).

To access this data, specify the fuel type and source by setting the
*fuel* and *sourceDocumentation* drill choices. The oxidation factor is
represented by the ***oxidationFactor*** data item value. The original
sources are as follows:

    *Revised 1996 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas
    inventories: Reference manual (Vol. 3)*. IPCC National Greenhouse
