The metadata hotel item is used to store profile information for hotels.
For example, the facilities of the hotel, the number of rooms and the
hotel rating. Most standard hotel facilities are included with a profile
item starting with "has" - these can be set to either true or false.

All of these are for information only and do affect calculations
elsewhere in the profile.
