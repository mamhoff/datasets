## Metadata

This category should contain just one profile item which is used to
store information about the profile. For example, which country it
relates to or whether it is for an individual or household.

The ***country*** profile item value is important as it will determine
the electricity factor used for any electrical appliances stored in the
profile and also the values used for certain forms of transport, e.g.
for a particular ***size*** of car (e.g. large in the UK and US have
different meanings). The country can be set to any of the drill down
options in [Electricity\_by\_country](Electricity_by_country) or
[Electricity\_by\_country\_ISO\_code](Electricity_by_country_ISO_code).
If unset, it defaults to United Kingdom.

The ***peopleInHousehold*** profile item value determines the default
usages in subcategories of [Cooking](Cooking) as well as the kettle and
microwave items in [Kitchen](Kitchen) and water heating in
[Heating\_uk](Heating_uk).

All other item values are for information only at present and the free
text ones can be used to hold information in a format of your choice.
